,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2020,,,2020,94,5,"Washington, D.C.",Journal Article,"Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host. Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains.",major,antibodies,minor,antibodies,major,cytopathogenicity,minor,cytopathogenicity,major,digestive tract,minor,digestive tract,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,lungs,minor,lungs,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome,major,proteolysis,minor,proteolysis,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,strains,minor,strains,major,trypsin,minor,trypsin,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,hosts,minor,hosts,major,Uganda,minor,Uganda,geo,Uganda,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,man,minor,man,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,gastrointestinal tract,minor,MERS-CoV,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,subsaharan Africa,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,ACP Countries,minor,Anglophone Africa,minor,Africa,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,East Africa,minor,Africa South of Sahara,minor,Least Developed Countries,minor,Developing Countries,"Menachery, V.

,,"""print""",22264485,Open Veterinary Journal,2020,,,2020,10,2,Tripoli,FTFF,"Viruses are having great time as they seem to have bogged humans down. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are the three major coronaviruses of present-day global human and animal health concern. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is identified as the newest disease, presumably of bat origin. Different theories on the evolution of viruses are in circulation, yet there is no denying the fact that the animal source is the skeleton. The whole world is witnessing the terror of the COVID-19 pandemic that is following the same path of SARS and MERS, and seems to be more severe. In addition to humans, several species of animals are reported to have been infected with these life-threatening viruses. The possible routes of transmission and their zoonotic potentialities are the subjects of intense research. This review article aims to overview the link of all these three deadly coronaviruses among animals along with their phylogenic evolution and cross-species transmission. This is essential since animals as pets or food are said to pose some risk, and their better understanding is a must in order to prepare a possible plan for future havoc in both human and animal health. Although COVID-19 is causing a human health hazard globally, its reporting in animals are limited compared to SARS and MERS. Non-human primates and carnivores are most susceptible to SARS-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, whereas the dromedary camel is susceptible to MERS-coronavirus. Phylogenetically, the trio viruses are reported to have originated from bats and have special capacity to undergo mutation and genomic recombination in order to infect humans through its reservoir or replication host.

,,,,Emerging Microbes and Infections,2020,,,2020,9,1567-1579,Abingdon,Journal Article,"Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats and other animal species. Like SARS-CoV, some bat SL-CoVs, such as WIV1, also use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from human and bat as entry receptor. However, whether these viruses can also use the ACE2 of other animal species as their receptor remains to be determined. We report herein that WIV1 has a broader tropism to ACE2 orthologs than SARS-CoV isolate Tor2. Among the 9 ACE2 orthologs examined, human ACE2 exhibited the highest efficiency to mediate the infection of WIV1 pseudotyped virus. Our findings thus imply that WIV1 has the potential to infect a wide range of wild animals and may directly jump to humans. We also showed that cell entry of WIV1 could be restricted by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). However, WIV1 could exploit the airway protease TMPRSS2 to partially evade the IFITM3 restriction. Interestingly, we also found that amphotericin B could enhance the infectious entry of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs by evading IFITM3-mediated restriction. Collectively, our findings further underscore the risk of exposure to animal SL-CoVs and highlight the vulnerability of patients who take amphotericin B to infection by SL-CoVs, including the most recently emerging (SARS-CoV-2).",major,amphotericin B,minor,amphotericin B,major,cytopathogenicity,minor,cytopathogenicity,major,efficacy,minor,efficacy,major,potency,minor,potency,major,proteins,minor,proteins,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Hamamelistes miyabei,minor,Hamamelistes miyabei,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,minor,SARS,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Hamamelistes,minor,Aphididae,minor,Aphidoidea,minor,Sternorrhyncha,minor,Hemiptera,minor,insects,minor,Hexapoda,minor,arthropods,minor,invertebrates,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zheng Mei,Zhao XueSen,Zheng ShuangLi,Chen DanYing,Du PengCheng,Li XingLin,Jiang Dong,Guo JuTao,Zeng Hui,Lin HanXin,,,,,Bat SARS-like WIV1 coronavirus uses the ACE2 of multiple animal species as receptor and evades IFITM3 restriction via TMPRSS2 activation of membrane fusion.,doi,10.1080/22221751.2020.1787797,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20203396083&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20203396083,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1567-1579,1579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Biodiversity Science,2020,,,2020,28,2,Beijing,Journal Article,"Since the beginning of the 21st century, two major infectious diseases, SARS and new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), have shocked China as well as the world. Studies suggested bats, as well as pangolins may be the vectors of both epidemics, prompting calls for a ban on eating wild animals. In fact, the country has already legislated against the consumption of legally protected and illegally sourced wild animals. Market survey found no bats for sale in those markets in 16 major Chinese megacities after SARS. Therefore, how did SARS-CoV and the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) spread from wild animals to humans? What lessons should we learn from these two epidemics? Besides a total ban on consumption wild animal meets from illegal source, I suggest to perfect the legislation of zoonosis and to fill the gaps in the laws concern with the prevention of zoonosis; to amend the provisions of the existing law governing the managing of zoonosis contaminated areas. A permanent institution should be set up to cover the whole process of wildlife epidemic investigation and monitoring, human-wildlife interface, quarantine, immunization of susceptible populations, popularization of law and scientific knowledge, thus to realize early prevention, early detection and early treatment of zoonosis to ensure public health security. I also recommend that to establish a mechanism for the prevention and control of zoonosis, to identify wildlife hosts of zoonosis pathogens, to strengthen bat monitoring, and to issue red lines for the control of zoonosis.

In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods: Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results: Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation & conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health.

Of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses, which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction. Sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses. Three novel alphacoronaviruses, three novel betacoronaviruses, and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast Asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in Myanmar.

In less than two decades, three members of the group, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-COV-2, have emerged causing disease outbreaks that affected millions and claimed the lives of thousands of people. In 2017, another coronavirus, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) coronavirus (SADS-CoV) emerged in animals killing over 24,000 piglets in China. Because of the medical and veterinary importance of coronaviruses, we carried out a review of available literature and summarized the current information on their properties and diversity. Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses with some unique characteristics such as the possession of a very large nucleic acid, high infidelity of the RNA-dependent polymerase, and high rate of mutation and recombination in the genome. They are susceptible to a number of physical agents and several chemical agents used for disinfection procedures in hospitals and laboratories. They exhibit considerable genetic and host diversity, causing diseases of gastrointestinal and respiratory system in a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans. The high prevalence of coronaviruses in domestic and wild animals, especially bats and birds, and the propensity for their genomes to undergo mutation and recombination may lead to emergence of new coronaviruses that could pose a serious threat to human and animal health.",major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,diarrhoea,minor,diarrhoea,major,digestive system,minor,digestive system,major,disinfection,minor,disinfection,major,domestic animals,minor,domestic animals,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,genomes,minor,genomes,major,hospitals,minor,hospitals,major,hosts,minor,hosts,major,incidence,minor,incidence,major,livestock,minor,livestock,major,nucleic acids,minor,nucleic acids,major,outbreaks,minor,outbreaks,major,pathogens,minor,pathogens,major,piglets,minor,piglets,major,recombination,minor,recombination,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,respiratory system,minor,respiratory system,major,RNA,minor,RNA,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,China,minor,China,geo,China,major,man,minor,man,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,pigs,minor,pigs,major,RNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,vertebrates,minor,vertebrates,minor,Coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,minor,Coronavirus disease,minor,People's Republic of China,"Joseph, A.

This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of &gt;30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV.

The most important pathogens in its aetiology are coronaviruses and rotaviruses, having features such as excretion in high concentrations, low infective dose, extreme environmental stability and high contagiousness. Coronaviruses are the causative agents of important epizootics with high mortalities in nursing piglets (up to 100%), in particular the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), which recently caused substantial losses for pig breeders in Croatia and worldwide. Apart from PEDV, notable coronaviruses in pigs are transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and the recently described swine acute diarrhoea syndrome-coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Rotaviruses are also significant pathogens causing diarrhoea in young pigs, even though they are ubiquitous, with Rotavirus A (RVA) being the most important species among five rotavirus species known to circulate in pigs. Rotaviruses are known to possess a zoonotic potential which is also speculated for porcine deltacoronavirus, nevertheless coronaviruses of pigs have not yet been detected in humans. The example of SADS-CoV transmission from bats to pigs emphasizes the need for surveillance of wild animals known as a source of diseases that present a veterinary and public health threat. The pathogenesis, clinical appearance, autopsy and pathohistological findings are similar for all viral gastroenteritis in pigs. In case of an outbreak of watery and yellowish diarrhoea of high morbidity and mortality, especially in nursing piglets, the suspicion of viral aetiology is warranted. Therefore, early diagnosis is key for the implementation of adequate measures to prevent the disease from spreading and causing substantial losses.

The close relatedness of Rs-BatCoV HKU32 to BatCoV HKU10 which was also detected in Pomona roundleaf bats from the same country park suggests that these viruses may have the tendency of infecting genetically distant bat populations of close geographical proximity with subsequent genetic divergence. Moreover, the presence of SARSr-CoV ORF7a-like protein in Rs-BatCoV HKU32 suggests a common evolutionary origin of this accessory protein with SARS-CoV, also from Chinese horseshoe bats, an apparent reservoir for coronavirus epidemics.

,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2019,,,2019,93,24,"Washington, D.C.",Journal Article,"Outbreaks of severe diarrhea in neonatal piglets in Guangdong, China, in 2017 resulted in the isolation and discovery of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) derived from the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (Y. Pan, X. Tian, P. Qin, B. Wang, et al., Vet Microbiol 211:15-21, 2017). SeACoV was later referred to as swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) by another group (P. Zhou, H. Fan, T. Lan, X.-L. Yang, et al., Nature 556:255-258, 2018). The present study was set up to investigate the potential species barriers of SADS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that SADS-CoV possesses a broad species tropism and is able to infect cell lines from diverse species, including bats, mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, pigs, chickens, nonhuman primates, and humans. Trypsin contributes to but is not essential for SADS-CoV propagation in vitro. Furthermore, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with the virus via oral or intraperitoneal routes. Although the mice exhibited only subclinical infection, they supported viral replication and prolonged infection in the spleen. SADS-CoV nonstructural proteins and double-stranded RNA were detected in splenocytes of the marginal zone on the edge of lymphatic follicles, indicating active replication of SADS-CoV in the mouse model. We identified that splenic dendritic cells (DCs) are the major targets of virus infection by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry approaches. Finally, we demonstrated that SADS-CoV does not utilize known CoV receptors for cellular entry. The ability of SADS-CoV to replicate in various cells lines from a broad range of species and the unexpected tropism for murine DCs provide important insights into the biology of this bat-origin CoV, highlighting its possible ability to cross interspecies barriers. IMPORTANCE: Infections with bat-origin coronaviruses (CoVs) (severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV [SARS-CoV] and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV [MERS-CoV]) have caused severe illness in humans after ""host jump"" events. Recently, a novel bat-HKU2-like CoV named swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) has emerged in southern China, causing lethal diarrhea in newborn piglets. It is important to assess the species barriers of SADS-CoV infection since the animal hosts (other than pigs and bats) and zoonotic potential are still unknown. An in vitro susceptibility study revealed a broad species tropism of SADS-CoV, including various rodent and human cell lines. We established a mouse model of SADS-CoV infection, identifying its active replication in splenic dendritic cells, which suggests that SADS-CoV has the potential to infect rodents. These findings highlight the potential cross-species transmissibility of SADS-CoV, although further surveillance in other animal populations is needed to fully understand the ecology of this bat-HKU2-origin CoV.",major,animal models,minor,animal models,major,dendritic cells,minor,dendritic cells,major,diarrhoea,minor,diarrhoea,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,flow cytometry,minor,flow cytometry,major,identification,minor,identification,major,immunofluorescence,minor,immunofluorescence,major,isolation,minor,isolation,major,newborn animals,minor,newborn animals,major,outbreaks,minor,outbreaks,major,piglets,minor,piglets,major,porcine coronaviruses,minor,porcine coronaviruses,major,RNA,minor,RNA,major,spleen,minor,spleen,major,splenocytes,minor,splenocytes,major,viral replication,minor,viral replication,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,China,minor,China,geo,China,major,Guangdong,minor,Guangdong,geo,Guangdong,major,Alphacoronavirus,minor,Alphacoronavirus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronavirinae,major,gerbils,minor,gerbils,major,hamsters,minor,hamsters,major,mice,minor,mice,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,pigs,minor,pigs,major,rats,minor,rats,major,Rhinolophus,minor,Rhinolophus,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,cross-species transmissibility,minor,diarrhea,minor,fluorescent antibody technique,minor,hogs,minor,IFAT,Yang YongLe,Qin Pan,Wang Bin,Liu Yan,Xu GuoHan,Peng Lei,Zhou Jiyong,"Zhu Shu [Zhu, S.

Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptors allows the definition of residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S, up to 7 can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S interface. Of note, pigs and dogs, which are not infected or are not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with that from bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV-RaTG13) and pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) strain hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019 revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas Bat-CoV-RaTG13 exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibits seven changes relative to human ACE2, and a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon dogs, and civets, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not be especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts.

It is important to characterize a virus at the nucleotide level to discover the virus's genomic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins. This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3rd position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively.

It was first described in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and very quickly its occurrence was found in European countries. Initially, it was associated with mild changes within the respiratory system, until a new type of virus was isolated in a patient with severe pneumonia and renal failure, who died. The study showed a close relationship between the virus isolated from the patient's cells with HKU4 and HKU5 coronaviruses, previously isolated from bats. The presence of the same virus was found in a patient from Qatar with a similar clinical image. MERS infections, despite relatively low infectivity, are characterized by high mortality (30%).

It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional PCR analysis detected diverse adenovirus and herpesvirus sequences that were widespread throughout Neoromicia populations in South Africa. Furthermore, similar adenovirus sequences were detected within these populations throughout several years.

Since the emergence of new coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in humans (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Nipah virus), numerous studies clearly established that bats can maintain some of these viruses. Improving our understanding on the role of bats in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus.

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges.

Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days.

There are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. Findings: A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at -80°C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and Megaderma lyra. Conclusions: CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand.

The tissue localization of DPP4 in humans, bats, camelids, pigs, and rabbits generally correlates with MERS-CoV tropism, highlighting the role of DPP4 in virus pathogenesis and transmission. However, MERS-CoV S1A does not indiscriminately bind to all α2,3-sialic acids, and the species-specific binding and tissue distribution of these sialic acids in different MERS-CoV-susceptible species have not been investigated. We established a novel method to detect these sialic acids on tissue sections of various organs of different susceptible species by using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1A. We found that the nanoparticles specifically bound to the nasal epithelial cells of dromedary camels, type II pneumocytes in human lungs, and the intestinal epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bats. Desialylation by neuraminidase abolished nanoparticle binding and significantly reduced MERS-CoV infection in primary susceptible cells. In contrast, S1A nanoparticles did not bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species, nor did they bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Both pigs and rabbits have been shown to shed less infectious virus than dromedary camels and do not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes.

Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association. Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts.

To elucidate the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses and their interspecies transmission pathway, samples were collected from different mammals in China. A novel coronavirus related to MERS-CoV, Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (Ea-HedCoV HKU31), was identified from two Amur hedgehogs. Genome analysis supported that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 represents a novel species under Merbecovirus, being most closely related to Erinaceus CoV from European hedgehogs in Germany, with 79.6% genome sequence identity. Compared to other members of Merbecovirus, Ea-HedCoV HKU31 possessed unique non-structural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus/VMC/DEU/2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptor-binding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31-RBD-hDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERS-CoV and Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31-RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4.

,,"""print""",379085,Bulletin de la Société de Pathologie Exotique,2015,,,2015,108,4,Cachan,Journal Article,"With more than 1 200 species, bats and flying foxes (Order Chiroptera) constitute the most important and diverse order of Mammals after Rodents. Many species of bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet, the population size and the particular densities observed in species with crowded roosting behavior, the population structure and migrations, the hibernation permitting overwintering of viruses, their particular innate and acquired immune response, probably related at least partially to their ability to fly, allowing persistent virus infections and preventing immunopathological consequences, etc. It is also necessary to get a better knowledge of the interactions between bats and ecologic changes induced by man and to attentively follow bat populations and their viruses through surveillance networks involving human and veterinary physicians, specialists of wild fauna, ecologists, etc. in order to understand the mechanisms of disease emergence, to try to foresee and, perhaps, to prevent viral emergences beforehand. Finally, a more fundamental research about immune mechanisms developed in viral infections is essential to reveal the reasons why Chiroptera are so efficient reservoir hosts.

Results showed that the number of effective codons (ENC) of these emerging bat SARSr-Co Vs proteins were close to 61, their codon usage bias were weak. The Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) analysis showed that the preferred codons of each protein were different, but tending to use the codons ending with A or U. In the choice of preferred codons, these new emerging bat SARSr-CoVs were highly consistent with SARS-Co Vs. ENC-Plot, neutral plot analysis and PR2 rule analysis indicated that the natural selection factors mainly influenced the evolution of these emerging bat SARSr-CoVs. Clustering analysis based on codon usage bias indicated that the emerging bat SARSr-CoVs were closely related to SARS-CoVs. In addition, these emerging bat SARSr-Co Vs were dispersedly clustered with SARSr-CoVs found in other regions. All of these shown that the new emerging bat SARSr-CoVs in Yunnan have higher degree of similarity to SARS-CoVs and have higher risks of cross species transmission.

Results: Approximately two-thirds of the respondents properly identified the causative agent of MERS-CoV as an RNA virus (66.4%, n=225) that is enveloped (68.1%, n=231). On the other hand, few respondents identified the proper number of strains or the genus (16.5% and 17.4%, respectively). More than half of the study sample identified the disease as zoonotic (57.2%, n=194). Similarly, 89.1% (n=302) identified that camels and bats are prone to infection with coronaviruses. Only 23.9% (n=81) properly identified March through May as the season with the highest transmission rate. There was a massive lack of adequate knowledge regarding prevalence of antibodies. Only 18.3% (n=62) of respondents identified PCR as the proper diagnostic confirmatory test for MERS-CoV infection. Regarding MERS-CoV clinical features, 76.4% (n=259) recognized the presence of sub-clinical infection, 64.7% (n=218) indicated that cases should be immediately isolated, and 46.9% (n=159) identified the main cause of mortality as respiratory failure. Conclusions: There is limited microbiological and virological knowledge of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare personnel in the southern region of Saudi Arabia, although the clinical aspects are known.",major,attitudes,minor,attitudes,major,clinical aspects,minor,clinical aspects,major,demography,minor,demography,major,health care,minor,health care,major,health care workers,minor,health care workers,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,incidence,minor,incidence,major,infections,minor,infections,major,knowledge,minor,knowledge,major,microbiology,minor,microbiology,major,mortality,minor,mortality,major,personnel,minor,personnel,major,RNA,minor,RNA,major,symptoms,minor,symptoms,major,upper respiratory tract infections,minor,upper respiratory tract infections,major,virology,minor,virology,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Middle East,minor,Middle East,geo,Middle East,major,Saudi Arabia,minor,Saudi Arabia,geo,Saudi Arabia,major,Camelus,minor,Camelus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,man,minor,man,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,RNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,major,viruses,minor,viruses,minor,camels,minor,clinical picture,minor,Coronavirus,minor,death rate,minor,employees,minor,MERS-CoV,minor,Near East,minor,ribonucleic acid,minor,staff,minor,syndromes,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,"Abbag, H.

However, despite the fact that a large number of genetically diverse SL-CoV sequences have been detected in bats, only two strains (named WIV1 and WIV16) have been successfully cultured in vitro. These two strains differ from SARS-CoV only in containing an extra open reading frame (ORF) (named ORFX), between ORF6 and ORF7, which has no homology to any known protein sequences. In this study, we constructed a full-length cDNA clone of SL-CoV WIV1 (rWIV1), an ORFX deletion mutant (rWIV1-ΔX), and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mutant (rWIV1-GFP-ΔX). Northern blotting and fluorescence microscopy indicate that ORFX was expressed during WIV1 infection. A virus infection assay showed that rWIV1-ΔX replicated as efficiently as rWIV1 in Vero E6, Calu-3, and HeLa-hACE2 cells. Further study showed that ORFX could inhibit interferon production and activate NF-κB.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been reported in bat species from Thailand, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. However no such work was conducted in Cambodia or Lao PDR.

They were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-PCR assay. A total of 93 samples (4.7%) from 17 genera of bats tested positive. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus (αCoV) and beta-CoV (βCoV), respectively. The βCoVs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats (family Pteropodidae) (n=55) clustered with other bat βCoVs of lineage D, whereas one coronavirus from Pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage C of βCoVs which also includes the MERS-CoV. αCoVs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat αCoV sequences previously published.

,,"""print""",17466148,BMC Veterinary Research,2017,,,2017,13,396,London,Journal Article,"Background: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. Results: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3-16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha-CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. Conclusions: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy.

Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae. Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.

Three recombinant N protein fragments (N1, N2, N3) of the isolated Scotophilus bat CoV/CYCU-S1/TW/2013 were expressed by Escherichia coli. WB analyses were performed with bat serum samples and the sera of a patient who recovered from a SARS-CoV infection. Fragment N2 contained a highly conserved motif among CoVs whereas N1 and N3 protein fragments were specific to the S. kuhlii bat CoV. A total of 32 fecal and 19 serum samples were collected in Changhua County and Yunlin County during 2013 and 2014. About 17 fecal samples tested positive for the RdRp gene with an overall prevalence of 53%. Sequences comparison showed that the Scotophilus bat CoV isolates in Taiwan belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus and were closest to Scotophilus bat CoV/Hainan/China/2005 and Diliman1552 G1/Philippines/2008, followed by porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus. Only one bat serum sample reacted positively to all 3 N protein fragments. Cross-reactivity was observed between N2 protein fragment and the sera of a patient recovered from a SARS-CoV infection. The results indicated that Scotophilus bat CoV was circulating endemically in chestnut bat population in Taiwan.",major,antibodies,minor,antibodies,major,diagnosis,minor,diagnosis,major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease surveys,minor,disease surveys,major,disease vectors,minor,disease vectors,major,epidemiological surveys,minor,epidemiological surveys,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,faecal examination,minor,faecal examination,major,nucleocapsid proteins,minor,nucleocapsid proteins,major,recombinant proteins,minor,recombinant proteins,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,reverse transcriptase PCR,minor,reverse transcriptase PCR,major,serological surveys,minor,serological surveys,major,seroprevalence,minor,seroprevalence,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,western blotting,minor,western blotting,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Taiwan,minor,Taiwan,geo,Taiwan,major,Alphacoronavirus,minor,Alphacoronavirus,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512,minor,Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512,major,Scotophilus kuhlii,minor,Scotophilus kuhlii,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,disease surveillance,minor,fecal examination,minor,Formosa,minor,reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,minor,RT-PCR,minor,SARS,minor,seroepidemiology,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,Su BoGang,Chen HongChang,Cheng HsiChi,Chen YiNing,,,,,,,,,,,Detection of bat coronavirus and specific antibodies in chestnut bat (Scotophilus kuhlii) population in central Taiwan.,,,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20163122113&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20163122113,76,,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Alphacoronavirus,minor,Scotophilus,minor,Vespertilionidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,19-26,26,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developed Countries,minor,South East Asia,,,,,,,,,minor,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) were found in palm civets from live animal markets in Guangdong and in various horseshoe bat species, which were believed to be the ultimate reservoir of SARSr-CoV. Till November 2018, 339 SARSr-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 274 from human, 18 from civets and 47 from bats [mostly from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), n = 30; and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), n = 9]. The human SARS-CoVs and civet SARSr-CoVs were collected in 2003/2004, while bat SARSr-CoVs were continuously isolated in the past 13 years even after the cessation of the SARS epidemic. SARSr-CoVs belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage B) of genus Betacoronavirus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position. Overall, it is observed that the SARSr-CoV genomes from bats in Yunnan province of China possess the highest nucleotide identity to those from civets. It is evident from both multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular SARSr-CoV from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nucleotide identity to the corresponding genes of SARSr-CoV from human/civets, resulting in the shift of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees. Our current model on the origin of SARS is that the human SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic in 2002/2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARSr-CoV ancestors in different horseshoe bat species.",major,epidemics,minor,epidemics,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,evolution,minor,evolution,major,genes,minor,genes,major,genomes,minor,genomes,major,molecular epidemiology,minor,molecular epidemiology,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,nucleotides,minor,nucleotides,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,China,minor,China,geo,China,major,Guangdong,minor,Guangdong,geo,Guangdong,major,Yunnan,minor,Yunnan,geo,Yunnan,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Rhinolophus,minor,Rhinolophus,major,Rhinolophus ferrumequinum,minor,Rhinolophus ferrumequinum,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,Viverridae,minor,Viverridae,minor,Rhinolophus sinicus,minor,People's Republic of China,minor,Kwantung,minor,DNA sequences,minor,SARS,minor,viral infections,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,East Asia,minor,Asia,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Central Southern China,minor,China,minor,Rhinolophidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,Rhinolophus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,"Luk, H.

However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.1-99.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1-95.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China.

All primary cases of MERS are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East. Some of these patients had contacted camels which shed virus and/or had positive serology. Most secondary cases are related to health care-associated clusters. The disease is especially severe in elderly men with comorbidities. Clinical severity may be related to MERS-CoV's ability to infect a broad range of cells with DPP4 expression, evade the host innate immune response, and induce cytokine dysregulation. Reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory and/or extrapulmonary specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis. Supportive treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis is often required in patients with organ failure.

Some of the bat transmitted zoonotic viral diseases such as Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and rabies may cause severe human casualties. They also harbor several other viruses such as MERS and SARS corona viruses, which may cause disease in human through direct spillover to human or through an intermediate host or vectors. Being reservoir hosts bats do not get affected by these viruses. This probably may happen due to the specificity of bat immune system, which reacts differently with viral pathogens in comparison to their other mammalian counterparts. Although bats are important reservoir hosts for several zoonotic viruses, very little information is available regarding host/virus relationships as only few experimental studies have been done on bat colonies, lack of expertise for study of bat immunology and antiviral responses and difficulty in conducting field work. However, with the advancement in epidemiology and molecular biology, these problems can be addressed, which will provide the insight into interactions of bats and zoonotic viruses.

Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread initially within China and then globally, resulting in a pandemic. Objective: This article describes predictive modelling of COVID-19 in general, and efforts within the Public Health Agency of Canada to model the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Canadian population to support public health decisions. Methods: The broad objectives of two modelling approaches, (1) an agent-based model and (2) a deterministic compartmental model, are described and a synopsis of studies is illustrated using a model developed in Analytica 5.3 software. Results: Without intervention, more than 70% of the Canadian population may become infected. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, applied with an intensity insufficient to cause the epidemic to die out, reduce the attack rate to 50% or less, and the epidemic is longer with a lower peak. If NPIs are lifted early, the epidemic may rebound, resulting in high percentages (more than 70%) of the population affected. If NPIs are applied with intensity high enough to cause the epidemic to die out, the attack rate can be reduced to between 1% and 25% of the population. Conclusion: Applying NPIs with intensity high enough to cause the epidemic to die out would seem to be the preferred choice. Lifting disruptive NPIs such as shut-downs must be accompanied by enhancements to other NPIs to prevent new introductions and to identify and control any new transmission chains.",major,epidemics,minor,epidemics,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,pandemics,minor,pandemics,major,public health,minor,public health,major,public health services,minor,public health services,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,wildlife,minor,wildlife,major,Canada,minor,Canada,geo,Canada,major,China,minor,China,geo,China,major,man,minor,man,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,minor,Coronavirus disease,minor,Coronavirus,minor,SARS,minor,People's Republic of China,minor,lung diseases,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,APEC countries,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,Developed Countries,minor,North America,minor,America,minor,OECD Countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,East Asia,minor,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ogden, N.

,,,,,2014,,,2014,,,São Paulo,Thesis,"Several viral emerging and re-emerging diseases have been described in bats. Environmental changes caused by humans associated with the adaptation of bats to urban areas increase the chance of transmission of these infectious diseases to humans and domestic animals. Coronaviruses studies associated with bats have shown that these hosts act as reservoirs for these viruses, while rotaviruses has been poorly studied in these hosts. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of Rotavirus and Coronavirus in several species of bats from São Paulo State, Brazil, and to perform phylogenetic inferences from Coronavirus RdRp and S genes, as well as from Rotavirus structural and non-structural proteins genes. To this end, RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing was used. Optimization criterion of distance and identities calculation of the nucleotides and amino acids among the obtained sequences and sequences retrieved from the GenBank were used for phylogenetic and molecular diversity analysis. The occurrence of Coronavirus was 2.95% (9/305) and of Rotavirus was 9.18% (28/305). According to phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene, eight strains were classified as Alphacoronavirus. The analysis of the CoV S gene showed that the starins of this study formed a single lineage, segregated from other alphacoronaviruses lineages. Regarding Rotavirus, it was possible to identify the genotype G3-P [3]-IX-RX-CX-MX-AX-NX-T3-E3-H6, similar to that reported in bats, horses and humans. In addition, another strain was classified as G20, similar to the genotype described in humans, while the genotypes found for VP4, NSP3 and NSP5 genes may be classified as new genotypes. These results show that bats may carry infectious agents of public health interest, but further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these animals as reservoirs and infectious sources of these viral zoonoses.",major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease surveys,minor,disease surveys,major,disease vectors,minor,disease vectors,major,epidemiological surveys,minor,epidemiological surveys,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,genes,minor,genes,major,genotypes,minor,genotypes,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,reverse transcriptase PCR,minor,reverse transcriptase PCR,major,strains,minor,strains,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Brazil,minor,Brazil,geo,Brazil,major,Sao Paulo,minor,Sao Paulo,geo,Sao Paulo,major,Alphacoronavirus,minor,Alphacoronavirus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Rotavirus,minor,Rotavirus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,disease surveillance,minor,DNA sequences,minor,reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,minor,RT-PCR,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Developing Countries,minor,Latin America,minor,America,minor,South America,minor,Threshold Countries,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,"Asano, K.

The environmental origin of MERS-CoV is as yet unknown; however, its genome sequence is closely related to those of two bat coronaviruses, named BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, which were derived from Chinese bat samples. A hallmark of highly pathogenic respiratory viruses is their ability to evade the innate immune response of the host. CoV accessory proteins, for example those from severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), have been shown to block innate antiviral signalling pathways. MERS-CoV, similar to SARS-CoV, has been shown to inhibit type I IFN induction in a variety of cell types in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that MERS-CoV and the phylogenetically related BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 may encode proteins with similar capabilities. In this study, we have demonstrated that the ORF4b-encoded accessory protein (p4b) of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 may indeed facilitate innate immune evasion by inhibiting the type I IFN and NF-κB signalling pathways.

Although two SARS-related Rhinolophus sinicus bat CoVs (SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs) previously detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Yunnan, RsSHC014 and Rs3367, possessed 95% genome identities to human and civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 protein exhibited only 32.2 to 33% amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. To elucidate the origin of SARS-CoV ORF8, we sampled 348 bats of various species in Yunnan, among which diverse alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, including potentially novel CoVs, were identified, with some showing potential interspecies transmission. The genomes of two betacoronaviruses, SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C, from greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), possessed 93% nucleotide identities to human/civet SARSr-CoV genomes. Although these two betacoronaviruses displayed lower similarities than SARSr-Rs-BatCoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367 in S protein to civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 proteins demonstrated exceptionally high (80.4 to 81.3%) amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs, compared to SARSr-BatCoVs from other horseshoe bats (23.2 to 37.3%). Potential recombination events were identified around ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, leading to the generation of civet SARSr-CoVs. The expression of ORF8 subgenomic mRNA suggested that the ORF8 protein may be functional in SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs. The high Ka/Ks ratio among human SARS-CoVs compared to that among SARSr-BatCoVs supported that ORF8 is under strong positive selection during animal-to-human transmission. Molecular clock analysis using ORF1ab showed that SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C diverged from civet/human SARSr-CoVs in approximately 1990.

For analysing coronavirus diversity in a bat species-rich country, a total of 421 anal swabs/faecal samples from Costa Rican bats were screened for CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences by a pancoronavirus PCR. Six families, 24 genera and 41 species of bats were analysed. The detection rate for CoV was 1%. Individuals (n=4) from four different species of frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia perspicillata and Carollia castanea) and nectivorous (Glossophaga soricina) bats were positive for coronavirus-derived nucleic acids.

,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2015,,,2015,89,23,Washington,Journal Article,"We previously showed that close relatives of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) exist in African bats. The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3' end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE: The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses.

,,"""print""",3048608,Archives of Virology,2010,,,2010,155,10,Wien,Journal Article,"The discovery of SARS-like coronavirus in bats suggests that bats could be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. However, previous studies indicated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a known SARS-CoV receptor, from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays. The results show that ACE2s of Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus support viral entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, albeit with different efficiency in comparison to that of the human ACE2. Further, the alteration of several key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ACE2 receptor efficiency, as predicted from a structural modeling study of the different bat ACE2 molecules. These data suggest that M. daubentoni and R. sinicus are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV and may be candidates as the natural host of the SARS-CoV progenitor viruses. Furthermore, our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ACE2 among bats is greater than that observed among known SARS-CoV susceptible mammals, highlighting the possibility that there are many more uncharacterized bat species that can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV or its progenitor viruses.

The book also offers an overview of the potential for zoonotic transmission of infectious diseases from bats to humans or domestic animals. While most prior publications on the subject have dealt only with bat viral infections, this text closely covers a wide range of bat infections, from viral and bacterial infections to protist and fungal infections. Chapters on viral infections cover rabies, filoviruses, henipaviruses, and other RNA viruses, as well as information on bat virome studies. The book then provides information on bacterial infections-including arthropod-borne and other bacteria that affect bats-before moving on to protist infections, including apicomplexans and kinetoplastids, and fungal infections, including white-nose syndrome, histoplasma capsulatum, and other fungi. Comprehensive in scope, yet another key feature of this book is a searchable database that includes bat species, bat family, bat diet, bat location, type and classification of infecting microbes, and categories of microbes. This vital resource also: Provides a history and comprehensive overview of bat-borne diseases Incorporates information from the World Health Organization, as well as historical data from the National Libraries of Health and infectious disease journals Covers a variety of diseases including viral infections, bacterial infections, protist infections, and fungal infections Written for microbiologist, bat researchers, and conservationists, Bats and Human Health provides a comprehensive exploration of the various types of microbes that affect bats and their potential to affect human populations.",major,bacterial diseases,minor,bacterial diseases,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,domestic animals,minor,domestic animals,major,health,minor,health,major,historical records,minor,historical records,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,infections,minor,infections,major,infectious diseases,minor,infectious diseases,major,libraries,minor,libraries,major,mycoses,minor,mycoses,major,publications,minor,publications,major,rabies,minor,rabies,major,research workers,minor,research workers,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,vector-borne diseases,minor,vector-borne diseases,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,white-nose syndrome,minor,white-nose syndrome,major,WHO,minor,WHO,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,arthropods,minor,arthropods,major,bacteria,minor,bacteria,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,fungi,minor,fungi,major,Histoplasma,minor,Histoplasma,major,Histoplasma capsulatum,minor,Histoplasma capsulatum,major,man,minor,man,major,Protozoa,minor,Protozoa,major,RNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,viruses,minor,viruses,minor,bacterial infections,minor,bacterioses,minor,bacterium,minor,communicable diseases,minor,Filovirus,"Beltz, L.

Most hunters catch bats during winter nights, using a net. Bat meat is used for household consumption, and the surplus is sold to cover household expenditures. They prepare the bat meat at home to sell it in their own and in neighboring communities. They also sell live bats to traditional healers. They report that the bat population has declined compared with 5 or 10 years ago, a decline they attribute to hunting and deforestation.

The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure; overall mortality is around 35.7%. Bats harbour several betacoronaviruses that are closely related to MERS-CoV but more research is needed to establish the relationship between bats and MERS-CoV. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is very high in dromedary camels in Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus have been isolated from dromedary camels, including some with respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, near-identical strains of MERS-CoV have been isolated from epidemiologically linked humans and camels, confirming inter-transmission, most probably from camels to humans. Though inter-human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV cases, the virus is incapable at present of causing sustained human-to-human transmission. Clusters can be readily controlled with implementation of appropriate infection control procedures. Phylogenetic and sequencing data strongly suggest that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors after undergoing a recombination event in the spike protein, possibly in dromedary camels in Africa, before its exportation to the Arabian Peninsula along the camel trading routes. MERS-CoV serosurveys are needed to investigate possible unrecognized human infections in Africa. Amongst the important measures to control MERS-CoV spread are strict regulation of camel movement, regular herd screening and isolation of infected camels, use of personal protective equipment by camel handlers and enforcing rules banning all consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and urine.",major,antibodies,minor,antibodies,major,asymptomatic infections,minor,asymptomatic infections,major,camel milk,minor,camel milk,major,clinical aspects,minor,clinical aspects,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,food safety,minor,food safety,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,infection control,minor,infection control,major,mortality,minor,mortality,major,nosocomial infections,minor,nosocomial infections,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,pneumonia,minor,pneumonia,major,protective clothing,minor,protective clothing,major,quarantine,minor,quarantine,major,recombination,minor,recombination,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,screening,minor,screening,major,seroprevalence,minor,seroprevalence,major,urine,minor,urine,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,East Africa,minor,East Africa,geo,East Africa,major,Middle East,minor,Middle East,geo,Middle East,major,Camelus,minor,Camelus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,dromedaries,minor,dromedaries,major,man,minor,man,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,camels,"Omrani, A.

Findings We show that bat DPP4 genes have been subject to significant adaptive evolution, suggestive of a long-term arms-race between bats and MERS related CoVs.

To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families.

Recently, influenza virus-like sequences were identified in bats; however, the viruses could not be cultured. This discovery aroused great interest in understanding the evolutionary history and pandemic potential of bat-influenza. Using synthetic genomics, we were unable to rescue the wild type bat virus, but could rescue a modified bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1). This modified bat-influenza virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in mice, resulting in severe disease. Additional studies using a bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA of A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) showed that the PR8 HA and NA contributed to the pathogenicity in mice. Unlike other influenza viruses, engineering truncations hypothesized to reduce interferon antagonism into the NS1 protein didn't attenuate bat-influenza. In contrast, substitution of a putative virulence mutation from the bat-influenza PB2 significantly attenuated the virus in mice and introduction of a putative virulence mutation increased its pathogenicity. Mini-genome replication studies and virus reassortment experiments demonstrated that bat-influenza has very limited genetic and protein compatibility with Type A or Type B influenza viruses, yet it readily reassorts with another divergent bat-influenza virus, suggesting that the bat-influenza lineage may represent a new Genus/Species within the Orthomyxoviridae family.

African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. Methods: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens. Results: From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats.

The recent implication of a novel beta (β)-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population. In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs. Nine were alpha (α)-CoVs; four were β-CoVs. Twelve were novel. Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs. A β-CoV with 96.5% amino acid identity to the β-CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae.

,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2014,,,2014,88,12,Washington,Journal Article,"Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoVs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. IMPORTANCE: Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV.

Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei)'s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. Methods: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January-December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n=64) and alphacoronavirus (n=4).

It is highly contagious and rapidly spread in the human population and compelled global public health institutions on high alert. Due to genetic similarity of this novel coronavirus 2019 with bat virus its emergence from bat to humans is possible. The virus survive in the droplets of coughing and sneezing and spread around the large areas through infected person resulting in its rapid spread among people. Clinical symptoms of CoViD-19 include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, loose stool, nausea and vomiting. The present review discuss the origin of CoViD-19, its rapid spread, mortality rate and recoveries ratio around the world. Since its origin from Wuhan, the CoViD-19 spread very rapidly all across the countries, on April 17, 2020 this disease has affected 210 countries of the globe. The data obtained showed over 2.4 million confirmed cases of CoViD-19. Higher mortality rate was found in Algeria and Belgium as 15% and 13.95%, respectively. Lower mortality rate was found in Qatar 0.17% and Singapore 0.2%.

Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.",major,body condition,minor,body condition,major,concurrent infections,minor,concurrent infections,major,dry season,minor,dry season,major,environmental degradation,minor,environmental degradation,major,faeces,minor,faeces,major,forest fragmentation,minor,forest fragmentation,major,forests,minor,forests,major,habitat degradation,minor,habitat degradation,major,logging,minor,logging,major,risk factors,minor,risk factors,major,seasonal variation,minor,seasonal variation,major,tropical forests,minor,tropical forests,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wet season,minor,wet season,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,Astroviridae,minor,Astroviridae,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,viruses,minor,viruses,minor,feces,minor,rainy season,minor,seasonal changes,minor,seasonal fluctuations,minor,timber extraction,minor,timber harvesting,minor,viral infections,minor,virus shedding,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Nidovirales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seltmann, A.","Corman, V.

In a surveillance study for CoV in noncaged animals from the wild areas of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region, we identified a CoV closely related to SARS-CoV (bat-SARS-CoV) from 23 (39%) of 59 anal swabs of wild Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) by using RT-PCR. Sequencing and analysis of three bat-SARS-CoV genomes from samples collected at different dates showed that bat-SARS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV from humans and civets. Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-SARS-CoV formed a distinct cluster with SARS-CoV as group 2b CoV, distantly related to known group 2 CoV. Most differences between the bat-SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV genomes were observed in the spike genes, ORF 3 and ORF 8, which are the regions where most variations also were observed between human and civet SARS-CoV genomes. In addition, the presence of a 29-bp insertion in ORF 8 of bat-SARS-CoV genome, not in most human SARS-CoV genomes, suggests that it has a common ancestor with civet SARS-CoV. Antibody against recombinant bat-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was detected in 84% of Chinese horseshoe bats by using an enzyme immunoassay.

MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs), which also includes viruses isolated from bats and hedgehogs. A large portion of the betaCoV genome consists of two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into polyproteins. These are cleaved by viral proteases to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) which compose the viral replication-transcription complex. We investigated the evolution of ORF1a and ORF1b in lineage C betaCoVs. Results indicated widespread positive selection, acting mostly on ORF1a. The proportion of positively selected sites in ORF1a was much higher than that previously reported for the surface-exposed spike protein. Selected sites were unevenly distributed, with nsp3 representing the preferential target. Several pairs of coevolving sites were also detected, possibly indicating epistatic interactions; most of these were located in nsp3. Adaptive evolution at nsp3 is ongoing in MERS-CoV strains, and two selected sites (G720 and R911) were detected in the protease domain. While position 720 is variable in camel-derived viruses, suggesting that the selective event does not represent a specific adaptation to humans, the R911C substitution was observed only in human-derived MERS-CoV isolates, including the viral strain responsible for the recent South Korean outbreak. It will be extremely important to assess whether these changes affect host range or other viral phenotypes.

The cluster was largely associated with a seafood and animal market. A novel Betacoronavirus was quickly identified as the causative agent, and it is shown to be related genetically to SARS-CoV and other bat-borne SARS-related Betacoronaviruses. The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to other provinces in China, as well as to another four countries. To help control the spread of the virus, a ""cordon sanitaire"" was instituted for Wuhan on January 23, 2020, and subsequently extended to other cities in Hubei Province, and the outbreak declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the Director General of the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This article described the evolution of the outbreak, and the known properties of the novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease it causes, and the major public health measures being used to help control it's spread. These measures include social distancing, intensive surveillance and quarantining of cases, contact tracing and isolation, cancellation of mass gatherings, and community containment.

,,"""print""",20571577,Virus Evolution,2017,,,2017,3,1,Oxford,Journal Article,"Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance. In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features. Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses. One unique gene at the 3′ end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus. Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-β production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-κB production. We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells.

,,"""print""",21945403,Environment Systems and Decisions,2014,,,2014,34,3,New York,Journal Article,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerged infection in humans affecting the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and North Africa. The source and persistence of the infection in humans remains unknown. The aim of this paper was to apply a risk analysis approach to the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and to understand the source of ongoing infections. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV was reviewed and compared to SARS. Each observed feature of MERS-CoV epidemiology was summarized and fitted to either an epidemic or one of two sporadic scenarios (either animal or deliberate release). As of May 2014, MERS-CoV has infected over 681 people and killed a further 204 over 2 years. In contrast, there were 8,273 cases and 775 deaths from SARS within 8 months. MERS-CoV has a more sporadic pattern unlike the clear epidemic pattern seen with SARS, and an unusual concentration of cases in the Middle East, without epidemics in other countries to which it has spread. SARS, with a higher reproductive number (R0), was eliminated from humans within 8 months of emerging, yet MERS-CoV, with a low R0 has persisted in humans over a far more prolonged period. This is at odds with the expected behavior of a virus with a low R0, which theoretically should not persist unless there are ongoing introductions of infection into humans, and poses the question ""what is the source of continuing infections in humans?"" A hospital outbreak in Al Ahsa, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), had a classic epidemic pattern with some human-to-human transmission. However, 3 different strains were identified in that outbreak, an unexpected and unexplained finding for what appears to be a single source outbreak. Since this outbreak in April 2013, there has been a large increase in new cases, mainly in KSA in April and May 2014, with no corresponding epidemics in other countries. Yet MERS-CoV was present in KSA over several mass gatherings (which predispose to epidemics), including the Hajj pilgrimage, without an epidemic arising. Furthermore, although the virus has been identified in bats and camels, the mode of ongoing transmission to humans remains uncertain. Although some cases appear to be transmitted from human to human, and a few have animal or camel exposure, many cases have no history of contact with either animals or human cases. A high proportion of asymptomatic or otherwise undetected cases have been postulated as an explanation for the unusual epidemiology, yet active surveillance does not support this. When the observed data were fitted to different disease patterns, the features of MERS-CoV fit better with a sporadic pattern, with evidence for either deliberate release or an animal source. There are many discrepancies in the observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV, which better fits a sporadic than an epidemic pattern. Possible explanations of the unusual features of the epidemiology include human-to-human transmission with a large proportion of undetected cases; or sporadic ongoing infections from a non-human source; or a combination of both. Possible sources of ongoing sporadic infection in humans include animals (camels appear the most likely source), or deliberate release. The latter could explain 3 strains being present in a single hospital outbreak. Genetic testing should be conducted to determine whether the virus is evolving to be more transmissible. Better ascertainment of mild or asymptomatic cases is also needed. Finally, the discrepant epidemiology warrants critical analysis of all possible explanations, and involvement of all stakeholders in biosecurity, and deliberate release must be seriously considered and at least acknowledged as a possibility.",major,asymptomatic infections,minor,asymptomatic infections,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,emerging infectious diseases,minor,emerging infectious diseases,major,epidemics,minor,epidemics,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,morbidity,minor,morbidity,major,mortality,minor,mortality,major,nosocomial infections,minor,nosocomial infections,major,outbreaks,minor,outbreaks,major,pilgrimages,minor,pilgrimages,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,risk analysis,minor,risk analysis,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,strains,minor,strains,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Middle East,minor,Middle East,geo,Middle East,major,Saudi Arabia,minor,Saudi Arabia,geo,Saudi Arabia,major,Camelus,minor,Camelus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,dromedaries,minor,dromedaries,major,man,minor,man,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,camels,minor,death rate,minor,emerging diseases,minor,emerging infections,minor,hospital infections,minor,lung diseases,minor,Near East,minor,SARS,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,"MacIntyre, C.

Anal swab samples from 32 Vespertilio superans bats were collected and were subjected to genetic analysis. After the analysis their full-length genome sequence were determined. It was confirmed that this novel betacoronavirus represents one of the most Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-like CoVs that have been identified in bats as of the end of March 2014. The full length genome sequence of the novel virus showed a closer genetic relationship with hCoV-MERS and camel MERS-CoV than with any other fully sequenced lineage C betacoronaviruses previously identified in bats or hedgehogs.

To date, 4,121,777 people have become infected and 280,868 people died as a result of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with many patients still under critical condition. The SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically similar to SARS-like bat viruses and, thus, bats can be a key host for SARS-CoV-2. Many viruses have been transmitted to humans due to the consumption of wild birds and animals as a food source. The lack of vaccine, improper containment, and diagnostic strategies by various countries have converted COVID-19 into a global pandemic. The lockdown conditions in developing countries may produce economic crises. COVID-19 patients can suffer from mental distress, partly resulting from quarantine restrictions, and therefore, there is dire need for mental counseling. The combination of previously used broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral and anti-parasite agents, and interferon have reduced viral infection at higher and frequent doses. Many patients have been discharged after clinical recovery, though COVID-19 can still leave severe adverse effects on patients. The use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has led to recovery of 90% of COVID-19 patients in China.

This statement considers whether the current risk assessment performed for birds and ground dwelling mammals exposed to pesticides is also protective of bats. Three main issues were addressed. Firstly, whether bats are toxicologically more or less sensitive than the most sensitive birds and mammals. Secondly, whether oral exposure of bats to pesticides is greater or lower than in ground dwelling mammals and birds. Thirdly, whether there are other important exposure routes relevant to bats. A large variation in toxicological sensitivity and no relationship between sensitivity of bats and bird or mammal test-species to pesticides could be found. In addition, bats have unique traits, such as echolocation and torpor which can be adversely affected by exposure to pesticides and which are not covered by the endpoints currently selected for wild mammal risk assessment. The current exposure assessment methodology was used for oral exposure and adapted to bats using bat-specific parameters. For oral exposure, it was concluded that for most standard risk assessment scenarios the current approach did not cover exposure of bats to pesticide residues in food. Calculations of potential dermal exposure for bats foraging during spraying operations suggest that this may be a very important exposure route. Dermal routes of exposure should be combined with inhalation and oral exposure. Based on the evidence compiled, the Panel concludes that bats are not adequately covered by the current risk assessment approach, and that there is a need to develop a bat-specific risk assessment scheme. In general, there was scarcity of data to assess the risks for bat exposed to pesticides.

As a result, 15-16 kb nucleotide sequences encoding complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins plus other open reading frames (ORFs) were generated. Sequences analysis confirmed that the CoVs from Kenya bats are divergent members of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. Furthermore, the CoVs BtKY22, BtKY41, and BtKY43 in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY24 in Betacoronavirus genus are likely representatives of 4 novel CoV species. BtKY27 and BtKY33 are members of the established bat CoV species in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY06 is a member of the established bat CoV species in Betacoronavirus genus. The genome organization of these seven CoVs is similar to other known CoVs from the same groups except for differences in the number of putative ORFs following the N gene. The present results confirm a significant diversity of CoVs circulating in Kenya bats. These Kenya bat CoVs are phylogenetically distant from any previously described human and animal CoVs.

Recent studies say, while MERS appears to be more deadly in those it infects, it also seems to be less contagious than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. All primary cases were connected to the Arabian Peninsula, and nearly half of the cases died due to severe lung inflammation. Nosocomial transmission was implied in 26 percent of the cases. Human-to-human-transmission was considered the likely source of infection in hospital. From these cases, the median incubation period was estimated as 5.2 days (95 percent confidence interval 2 to 15 days). At the same time, some asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been reported. All MERS-positive cases were diagnosed by using real-time RT-PCR targeting upE and Orf1a genes of MERS-CoV. Specimens were taken from the upper or the lower respiratory tract and blood. Even though over a year has passed since the emergence of the 1st case, many questions on the origin and transmission patterns of the disease remain. The pathogen of MERS belongs to the lineage C of the beta coronaviruses (CoV), which are genetically similar to various coronaviruses detected in bats in Africa and Europe. And two studies suggest dromedary camels in Oman, the Canary Islands and Egypt may have been infected with the virus or a MERS-CoV-like virus in the past. However, human cases have not been detected in these areas.

,,"""print""",15671348,"Infection, Genetics and Evolution",2011,,,2011,11,7,Amsterdam,Journal Article,"One of the great challenges in the ecology of infectious diseases is to understand what drives the emergence of new pathogens including the relationship between viruses and their hosts. In the case of the emergence of SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of SARS-CoV infection in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease. To elucidate the biogeographic origin of SARS-CoV and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence, we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout Thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences. To this end, RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae was targeted by RT-PCR in non-invasive samples from bats collected in Thailand. Two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species: one Betacoronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus and one Alphacoronavirus in Hipposiderosarmiger. Interestingly, these viruses from South-East Asia are related to those previously detected in Africa (Betacoronavirus-b) or in Europe (Alphacoronavirus & Betacoronavirus-b). These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human. All reported Betacoronaviruses-b (SARS-CoV group) of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts, which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of Betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families. Moreover, despite its probable pathogenicity, we found that a Betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony. These findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence. The host's phylogeny, biogeography and behaviour, combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence. Elucidating the common ancestor of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of SARS-CoV.",major,evolution,minor,evolution,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,molecular genetics,minor,molecular genetics,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,Thailand,minor,Thailand,geo,Thailand,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,biochemical genetics,minor,SARS,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Coronavirus,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,APEC countries,minor,ASEAN Countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,South East Asia,minor,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gouilh, M.

Bats can harbor many different viruses, among which some are highly pathogenic for humans (for instance, Nipah, Ebola and SARS coronavirus), and also several astroviruses. As some RNA viruses can be directly transmitted from bats to humans, it is crucial to collect data about their frequency, genetic diversity and phylogenetic characterization. In this study, we report the molecular identification of 44 new astroviruses (with a detection rate of 4.5%) in 962 apparently healthy bats that belong to five different species and that were captured in different caves in North-East Gabon, Central Africa. Our results show that bat astroviruses form a group that is genetically distinct from astroviruses infecting other mammals.

Moreover, African bats also carry other potentially zoonotic agents such as Henipah-like viruses, coronaviruses and lyssaviruses. Today only little information is available on interactions between humans and bats. The objective of our exploratory study was to describe the extent and modes of contacts between humans and bats in southern Cameroon, considered as an area at risk for future EBV outbreaks. The survey was conducted in 11 villages of four distinct rural areas in southern Cameroon. A total of 135 respondents were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires, between February and May 2017. The study showed that direct contacts between bats and humans are relatively common. Bat bushmeat appeared to be an occasional meat resource; 40% of respondents consume bats with a median annual consumption of three, and 28% of respondents hunt them. About 22% of the respondents reported children catching bats. Indirect contact also appeared to be common; 55% of hunters use caves as shelters and 67% of interviewees eat fruits previously chewed by bats. Bat consumption varied significantly between regions (from 0% to 87%) and between pygmies and bantus in the extreme south-east of Cameroon. The study revealed considerable diversity in practices among interviewees, most of them being subsistence cultivators and relying on self-hunted bushmeat.

Coronavirus RNA was detected in 55 of 248 (22%) of bat faecal samples; filovirus RNA was not detected in any of the bat samples. Further, coronavirus RNA was detected in 12 of 270 (4.4%) of rat faecal samples; all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus.

Here, we further characterize TevPV through analysis of whole-genome sequencing, growth kinetics, antigenic relatedness and the experimental infection of ferrets and mice. TevPV is phylogenetically and antigenically most closely related to Tioman virus (TioPV). Unlike many other rubulaviruses, cell receptor attachment by TevPV does not appear to be sialic acid-dependent, with the receptor for host cell entry being unknown. The infection of ferrets and mice suggested that TevPV has a low pathogenic potential in mammals. Infected ferrets seroconverted by 10 days post-infection without clinical signs of disease. Furthermore, infected ferrets did not shed virus in any respiratory secretions, suggesting a low risk of onward transmission of TevPV.

In this study, we generated a novel approximately 10-kb molecular data set of 19 nuclear exon and intron gene fragments for 40 bat species to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae. We estimated divergence times and explored potential reasons for any incongruent phylogenetic signal. We demonstrated the effects of outlier taxa and genes on phylogenetic reconstructions and compared the relative performance of intron and exon data to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses produced a well-resolved phylogeny, supporting the familial status of Hipposideridae and demonstrated the paraphyly of the largest genus, Hipposideros. A fossil-calibrated timetree and biogeographical analyses estimated that Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae diverged in Africa during the Eocene approximately 42 Ma. The phylogram, the timetree, and a unique retrotransposon insertion supported the elevation of the subtribe Rhinonycterina to family level and which is diagnosed herein. Comparative analysis of diversification rates showed that the speciose genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros underwent diversification during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The intron versus exon analyses demonstrated the improved nodal support provided by introns for our optimal tree, an important finding for large-scale phylogenomic studies, which typically rely on exon data alone. With the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a novel coronavirus, the study of these species is urgent as they are considered the natural reservoir for emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. It has been shown that host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines a virus's persistence, replicative ability, and can act as a predictor of new emerging disease. Therefore, this newly resolved phylogeny can be used to direct future assessments of viral diversity and to elucidate the origin and development of SARS-like coronaviruses in mammals.",major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,disease vectors,minor,disease vectors,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,evolution,minor,evolution,major,exons,minor,exons,major,genes,minor,genes,major,introns,minor,introns,major,outbreaks,minor,outbreaks,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,transposable elements,minor,transposable elements,major,vector-borne diseases,minor,vector-borne diseases,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Africa,minor,Africa,geo,Africa,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Hipposideridae,minor,Hipposideridae,major,Hipposideros,minor,Hipposideros,major,mammals,minor,mammals,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,Rhinolophidae,minor,Rhinolophidae,major,Rhinolophus,minor,Rhinolophus,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,DNA insertion elements,minor,insertion elements,minor,insertion sequences,minor,mobile genetic elements,minor,mobile sequences,minor,SARS,minor,transposons,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,"Foley, N.

,,"""print""",21412529,Journal of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health,2017,,,2017,9,3,Lagos,Journal Article,"Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is a novel enzootic beta origin corona virus which was described in September 2012 for the first time. According to the reports of different researchers, the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, during serological examination, is very high in dromedary camels of Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. However, the infection in camel is mostly asymptomatic. In contrast to the camel case, the clinical signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure with an overall mortality rate of about 35%. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to review the public health risk, transmission routes of Middle East respiratory syndrome and to recommend the disease for further research. The identification of MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus from dromedary camels, including samples with respiratory symptoms by different studies have been detected especially in isolation of identical strains of MERS-CoV from epidemiologically linked humans and camels are the suggestive evidence for inter-transmission of the virus, primarily from camels to humans and its public health risks. Though inter-human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV human cases, the virus is currently incapable of causing sustained human-to-human transmission (pandemic occurrence). Phylogenetic studies and viral sequencing results strongly suggest that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors after evolutionary recombination process, primarily in dromedary camels in Africa, before its exportation to the Arabian Peninsula through the camel trading routes. Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine available for treatment and prevention of infections due to MERS-CoV in patients. The important measures to control MERS-CoV spread are strict regulation of camel movement, regular herd screening and isolation of infected camels, use of personal protective equipment by camel handlers and awareness creation on the public, especially in African pastoralists where consumption of unpasteurized camel milk is common. Therefore, urgent global epidemiological studies are required, especially in the poor camel rearing African countries to understand the transmission patterns and the human cases of MERS-CoV and also for the proper implementation of the above mentioned control measures.",major,antibodies,minor,antibodies,major,clinical aspects,minor,clinical aspects,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,evolution,minor,evolution,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,mortality,minor,mortality,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,public health,minor,public health,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,risk factors,minor,risk factors,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Africa,minor,Africa,geo,Africa,major,East Africa,minor,East Africa,geo,East Africa,major,Camelus,minor,Camelus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,dromedaries,minor,dromedaries,major,man,minor,man,major,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,camels,minor,clinical picture,minor,death rate,minor,lung diseases,minor,subsaharan Africa,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Camelus,minor,Camelidae,minor,Tylopoda,minor,Artiodactyla,minor,Africa South of Sahara,minor,Africa,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,Andualem Yimer,Sisay Fanta,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public health risk and transmission route of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): MERS coronavirus in dromedary camel.,doi,10.5897/JVMAH2016.0519,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20173129268&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20173129268,143,,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39-46,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), with animal reservoirs found in bats and other wild animals and thus the possibility of reemergence. In this study, we first investigated at 6 years postinfection whether SARS-specific memory T cells persist in SARS-recovered individuals, demonstrating that these subjects still possess polyfunctional SARS-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A dominant memory CD8+ T cell response against SARS-CoV nucleocaspid protein (NP; amino acids 216 to 225) was then defined in SARS-recovered individuals carrying HLA-B*40:01, a HLA-B molecule present in approximately one-quarter of subjects of Asian ethnicities. To reconstitute such a CD8+ T cell response, we isolated the alpha and beta T cell receptors of the HLA-B*40:01-restricted SARS-specific CD8+ T cells.

A group of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) has been identified in horseshoe bats. SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat. In addition to full-length S of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone. Several important observations were made from this study. First, the SL-CoV S was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor. Second, the SARS-CoV S failed to enter cells expressing the bat ACE2. Third, the chimeric S covering the previously defined receptor-binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2, albeit with different efficiencies for different constructs. Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function.

We screened for both DNA and RNA viruses; specifically, astroviruses (AstVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), caliciviruses (CalVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), flaviviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses (PMVs), polyomaviruses (PYVs) and rotaviruses. We used family-specific primers, amplicon sequencing and further characterization by phylogenetic analysis. Except for filoviruses, eight virus families were detected with varying distributions and positive rates across the five regions (former provinces) studied. AstVs (12.83%), CoVs (3.97%), PMV (2.4%), ADV (2.26%), PYV (1.65%), CalVs (0.29%), rotavirus (0.19%) and flavivirus (0.19%). Novel CalVs were detected in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Mops condylurus while novel Rotavirus-A-related viruses were detected in Taphozous bats and R. aegyptiacus. The two Rotavirus A (RVA) strains detected were highly related to human strains with VP6 genotypes I2 and I16. Genotype I16 has previously been assigned to human RVA-strain B10 from Kenya only, which raises public health concern, particularly considering increased human-bat interaction. Additionally, 229E-like bat CoVs were detected in samples originating from Hipposideros bats roosting in sites with high human activity. Our findings confirm the presence of diverse viruses in Kenyan bats while providing extended knowledge on bat virus distribution. The detection of viruses highly related to human strains and hence of public health concern, underscores the importance of continuous surveillance.",major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease surveys,minor,disease surveys,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,epidemiological surveys,minor,epidemiological surveys,major,genotypes,minor,genotypes,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Kenya,minor,Kenya,geo,Kenya,major,Adenoviridae,minor,Adenoviridae,major,Astroviridae,minor,Astroviridae,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Filoviridae,minor,Filoviridae,major,Flavivirus,minor,Flavivirus,major,Hipposideros,minor,Hipposideros,major,Mops condylurus,minor,Mops condylurus,major,Paramyxovirinae,minor,Paramyxovirinae,major,Polyomavirus,minor,Polyomavirus,major,Rotavirus,minor,Rotavirus,major,Rotavirus A,minor,Rotavirus A,major,Rousettus aegyptiacus,minor,Rousettus aegyptiacus,major,Taphozous,minor,Taphozous,major,Vesivirus,minor,Vesivirus,minor,disease surveillance,minor,subsaharan Africa,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,dsDNA Viruses,minor,DNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,Flaviviridae,minor,Hipposideridae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,ACP Countries,"Waruhiu, C.","Ommeh, S.","Obanda, V.","Agwanda, B.","Gakuya, F.",Ge XingYi,Yang XingLou,Wu LiJun,"Zohaib, A.",Hu Ben,Shi ZhengLi,,,,"Molecular detection of viruses in Kenyan bats and discovery of novel astroviruses, caliciviruses and rotaviruses.",doi,10.1007/s12250-016-3930-2,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20183172808&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20183172808,155,,minor,Anglophone Africa,minor,Africa,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,Developing Countries,minor,East Africa,minor,Africa South of Sahara,minor,Mops,minor,Molossidae,minor,Paramyxoviridae,minor,Polyomaviridae,minor,Sedoreovirinae,minor,Reoviridae,101-114,114,minor,dsRNA Viruses,minor,Rotavirus,minor,Rousettus,minor,Pteropodidae,minor,Emballonuridae,,,,,,,,,minor,Caliciviridae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As bats are important hosts involved in the emergence and spread of zoonotic infections, it is becoming more important to discriminate the different species of bats involved in the maintenance of causative agents. However, traditional taxonomic methods rely on morphological features and are challenging as they require long-lasting experience of an investigator and sometimes fail if the specimen is of poor condition. On the other hand, barcoding requires sequencing and is time consuming. Therefore, a versatile genetic approach for rapid species identification would be valuable.In this study, two mitochondrial loci, cytochrome b (cyt b) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) were selected for the development of two multiplex qPCRs for differentiating four very abundant bat species in Germany using DNA extracted from the patagium or organ pools. Verification of the developed assays using a set of 1000 individual bat samples belonging to 20 different European species clearly showed that the multiplex qPCRs were able to determine the four most abundant species in this collection by a COI based qPCR. All other bat species which could not be covered by this approach could be easily identified by sequencing of the amplicon generated by broad-range qPCRs for cyt B and COI, respectively.

,,"""print""",21507511,mBio,2012,,,2012,3,6,Washington,Journal Article,"A new human coronavirus (hCoV-EMC) has emerged very recently in the Middle East. The clinical presentation resembled that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as encountered during the epidemic in 2002/2003. In both cases, acute renal failure was observed in humans. HCoV-EMC is a member of the same virus genus as SARS-CoV but constitutes a sister species. Here we investigated whether it might utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV receptor. Knowledge of the receptor is highly critical because the restriction of the SARS receptor to deep compartments of the human respiratory tract limited the spread of SARS. In baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, lentiviral transduction of human ACE2 (hACE2) conferred permissiveness and replication for SARS-CoV but not for hCoV-EMC. Monkey and human kidney cells (LLC-MK2, Vero, and 769-P) and swine kidney cells were permissive for both viruses, but only SARS-CoV infection could be blocked by anti-hACE2 antibody and could be neutralized by preincubation of virus with soluble ACE2. Our data show that ACE2 is neither necessary nor sufficient for hCoV-EMC replication. Moreover, hCoV-EMC, but not SARS-CoV, replicated in cell lines from Rousettus, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Myotis, and Carollia bats, representing four major chiropteran families from both suborders. As human CoV normally cannot replicate in bat cells from different families, this suggests that hCoV-EMC might use a receptor molecule that is conserved in bats, pigs, and humans, implicating a low barrier against cross-host transmission.",major,cell lines,minor,cell lines,major,human coronaviruses,minor,human coronaviruses,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,pathogenesis,minor,pathogenesis,major,virulence,minor,virulence,major,Carollia,minor,Carollia,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,man,minor,man,major,Myotis,minor,Myotis,major,Pipistrellus,minor,Pipistrellus,major,Rhinolophus,minor,Rhinolophus,major,Rousettus,minor,Rousettus,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Coronavirus,minor,Human coronavirus,minor,Pteropodidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Rhinolophidae,minor,Vespertilionidae,minor,Phyllostomidae,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Müller, M.

Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor.

Aquatic environments, lakes, rivers and ponds, are important habitats for bats and birds, which are hosts for various coronavirus species and strains and which shed viral particles in their feces. It is therefore of high interest to fully explore the role that aquatic environments may play in coronavirus spread, including cross-species transmissions. Besides the respiratory tract, coronaviruses pathogenic to humans can also infect the digestive system and be subsequently defecated. Considering this, it is pivotal to understand whether wastewater can play a role in their dissemination, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. This review provides an overview of the taxonomy, molecular biology, natural reservoirs and pathogenicity of coronaviruses; outlines their potential to survive in aquatic environments and wastewater; and demonstrates their association with aquatic biota, mainly waterfowl.

In this review, we describe virological, clinical, epidemiological features and interim travel advice and guidelines regarding MERS-CoV. We compare and contrast these with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Recent findings: MERS-CoV is a novel β CoV that causes a spectrum of clinical illness from asymptomatic to the rapidly fatal disease mainly in those with comorbid conditions. Epidemiological and genomic studies show zoonotic transmission to humans from camels and possibly bats. In contrast to the SARS-CoV pandemic, very limited global spread of fatal MERS-CoV has occurred outside the Arabian Peninsula. Although mainly currently restricted to Middle Eastern countries, MERS-CoV was reported from at least 10 other countries in Europe, Asia and the United States. All primary cases have been linked to travel to the Middle East. Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred because of poor infection control measures. Specific molecular diagnostic tests are available. Currently, there are no specific drugs for prevention or treatment for MERS-CoV and vaccine development is in the early stages. Advice and guidance for travelers to the Middle East are updated regularly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Summary: Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV threatens global health security.

The ability of bats to harbour these viruses in the absence of clinical signs of disease has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat biology and virus-host interactions. Interest in bats, in Australia in particular, has intensified following the identification of several novel bat-borne viruses from flying-foxes, including Hendra virus, which is capable of spillover from bats to horses and subsequently to humans with potentially fatal consequences.

We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines.

Some studies proposed pangolin, snake, or turtle as the intermediate hosts. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which determines the potential host range for SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of structural information of the complex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), we analyzed the affinity to S protein of the 20 key residues in ACE2 from mammal, bird, turtle, and snake. Several ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae, and Cetacea maintained the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The simulated structures indicated that ACE2 proteins from Bovidae and Cricetidae were able to associate with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that nearly half of the key residues in turtle, snake, and bird were changed. The simulated structures showed several key contacts with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in turtle and snake ACE2 were abolished.

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi-Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.",major,disease distribution,minor,disease distribution,major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,geographical distribution,minor,geographical distribution,major,hosts,minor,hosts,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,rabies,minor,rabies,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,spatial distribution,minor,spatial distribution,major,spatial variation,minor,spatial variation,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoogeography,minor,zoogeography,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Africa,minor,Africa,geo,Africa,major,America,minor,America,geo,America,major,Asia,minor,Asia,geo,Asia,major,Europe,minor,Europe,geo,Europe,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Rabies virus,minor,Rabies virus,major,rodents,minor,rodents,minor,animal geography,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Lyssavirus,minor,Rhabdoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,"Nieto-Rabiela, F.","Suzán, G.","Wiratsudakul, A.","Rico-Chávez, O.",,,,,,,,,,,Viral metacommunities associated to bats and rodents at different spatial scales.,doi,10.1556/168.2018.19.2.9,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20193460703&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20193460703,171,,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,168-175,175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kidneys, spleen, and liver were collected and used in the total DNA extraction. Toxoplasma gondii infection was detected through the amplification of a B1 gene fragment, using nested PCR. The positive PCR products were purified and sent to sequencing for a posterior sequence identity analysis. Additionally, a phylogenetic tree was made. A total of 69 bats belonging to eight different species were processed: 41 (59.4%, 41/69) Artibeus jamaicensis; six (8.7%, 6/69) Pteronotus parnellii; six (8.7%, 6/69) Noctilio leporinus; six (8.7%, 6/69) Chiroderma villosum; four (5.8%, 4/69) Glossophaga soricina; two (2.9%, 2/69) Carollia sowelli; two (2.89%, 2/69) Artibeus lituratus; and two (2.9%, 2/69) Rhogeessa aeneus.

How bats asymptomatically coexist with these viruses is unknown. In particular, little is known about bat adaptive immunity, and the presence of functional MHC molecules is mostly inferred from recently described genomes. In this study, we used an affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach to demonstrate that a bat MHC class I molecule, Ptal-N*01:01, binds antigenic peptides and associates with peptide-loading complex components. We identified several bat MHC class I-binding partners, including calnexin, calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2. Additionally, endogenous peptide ligands isolated from Ptal-N*01:01 displayed a relatively broad length distribution and an unusual preference for a C-terminal proline residue. Finally, we demonstrate that this preference for C-terminal proline residues was observed in Hendra virus-derived peptides presented by Ptal-N*01:01 on the surface of infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify endogenous and viral MHC class I ligands for any bat species and, as such, provides an important avenue for monitoring and development of vaccines against major bat-borne viruses both in the reservoir and spillover hosts. Additionally, it will provide a foundation to understand the role of adaptive immunity in bat antiviral responses.",major,antigens,minor,antigens,major,emerging infectious diseases,minor,emerging infectious diseases,major,genome analysis,minor,genome analysis,major,immune response,minor,immune response,major,immunity,minor,immunity,major,major histocompatibility complex,minor,major histocompatibility complex,major,mass spectrometry,minor,mass spectrometry,major,peptides,minor,peptides,major,proline,minor,proline,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,vaccine development,minor,vaccine development,major,vaccines,minor,vaccines,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Ebolavirus,minor,Ebolavirus,major,Henipavirus,minor,Henipavirus,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,antigenicity,minor,calnexin,minor,calreticulin,minor,emerging diseases,minor,emerging infections,minor,histocompatibility complex,minor,immunity reactions,minor,immunogens,minor,immunological reactions,minor,protein disulfide isomerase A3,minor,tapasin,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Filoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Paramyxovirinae,minor,Paramyxoviridae,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,minor,Betacoronavirus,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,,,,,,,,,"Wynne, J.

Mechanisms underlying the recognized association between ecosystem health and human health remain poorly understood and responding appropriately to the ecological, social and economic conditions that facilitate disease emergence and transmission represents a substantial societal challenge. In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings.

The discovery of this virus was soon followed by the discovery of the civet and bat SARS-CoV and the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Surveillance of coronaviruses in many animal species has increased the number on the list of coronaviruses to at least 36. The explosive nature of the first SARS epidemic, the high mortality, its transient reemergence a year later, and economic disruptions led to a rush on research of the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease. This research resulted in over 4,000 publications, only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article. The marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return.

,,"""print""",10705287,Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine,2014,,,2014,20,3,Hagerstown,Journal Article,"Purpose of review: This review compares the clinical features, laboratory aspects and treatment options of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Recent findings: Bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) and are likely the reservoir of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although a small number of camels have been found to have positive nasal swabs by real-time polymerase chain reaction and to carry antibody against MERS-CoV, the transmission route and the intermediary animal source remain uncertain amongst the sporadic primary cases. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe respiratory failure and extrapulmonary features such as diarrhoea, whereas mild or asymptomatic cases also occur in both conditions. In comparison with SARS, patients with MERS are older with male predominance, more comorbid illness and relatively lower human-to-human transmission potential. Although the viral kinetics of MERS-CoV remain unknown, nosocomial infections of MERS occur early within the first week of illness of the index case, whereas those of SARS occurred mainly in the second week of illness when the patient's upper airway viral load peaks on day 10 of illness. In-vitro data suggest that interferon (IFN) with or without ribavirin and mycophenolic acid may inhibit MERS-CoV, whereas protease inhibitors and IFN have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. Summary: Although there are some similarities in the clinical features, MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly than SARS. The higher case fatality rate of MERS is likely related to older age and comorbid illness. More studies are needed to understand MERS-CoV in order to guide public health infection control measures and treatment.",major,acute infections,minor,acute infections,major,age,minor,age,major,antiviral agents,minor,antiviral agents,major,antiviral properties,minor,antiviral properties,major,asymptomatic infections,minor,asymptomatic infections,major,clinical aspects,minor,clinical aspects,major,diarrhoea,minor,diarrhoea,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,in vitro,minor,in vitro,major,interferon,minor,interferon,major,nosocomial infections,minor,nosocomial infections,major,proteinase inhibitors,minor,proteinase inhibitors,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,ribavirin,minor,ribavirin,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,Betacoronavirus,minor,Betacoronavirus,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,dromedaries,minor,dromedaries,major,man,minor,man,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,anti-viral properties,minor,camels,minor,clinical picture,minor,comorbidity,minor,diarrhea,minor,hospital infections,minor,lung diseases,minor,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,mycophenolic acid,minor,protease inhibitors,minor,respiratory insufficiency,minor,SARS,minor,scouring,minor,severe infections,minor,tribavirin,minor,viral infections,minor,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronaviridae,"Hui, D.

While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.

In addition to degrading the habitats of cave-roosting bats, such activities often promote contact between humans and bats, which may have potential impacts on human health. Cave-roosting bats are hosts to diverse viruses, some of which emerged in humans with severe consequences (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Marburg virus). Characterizing patterns of viral richness and sharing among bat species are therefore important first steps for understanding bat-virus dynamics and mitigating future bat-human spillover. Here we compile a database of bat-virus associations and bat species ecological traits, and investigate the importance of roosting behavior as a determinant of viral richness and viral sharing among bat species. We show that cave-roosting species do not host greater viral richness, when accounting for publication bias, diet, body mass, and geographic range size. Our global analyses, however, show that cave-roosting bats do exhibit a greater likelihood of viral sharing, especially those documented in the literature as co-roosting in the same cave.

Bats have been suggested to act as natural reservoirs for both these viruses, and periodic monitoring of coronaviruses in bats may thus provide important clues about emergent infectious viruses. The Eastern bent-wing bat Miniopterus fuliginosus is distributed extensively throughout China. We therefore analyzed the genetic diversity of coronaviruses in samples of M. fuliginosus collected from nine Chinese provinces during 2011-2013. The only coronavirus genus found was Alphacoronavirus. We established six complete and five partial genomic sequences of alphacoronaviruses, which revealed that they could be divided into two distinct lineages, with close relationships to coronaviruses in Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus. Recombination was confirmed by detecting putative breakpoints of Lineage 1 coronaviruses in M. fuliginosus and M. pusillus (Wu et al., 2015), which supported the results of topological and phylogenetic analyses. The established alphacoronavirus genome sequences showed high similarity to other alphacoronaviruses found in other Miniopterus species, suggesting that their transmission in different Miniopterus species may provide opportunities for recombination with different alphacoronaviruses. The genetic information for these novel alphacoronaviruses will improve our understanding of the evolution and genetic diversity of coronaviruses, with potentially important implications for the transmission of human diseases.",major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,evolution,minor,evolution,major,genetic diversity,minor,genetic diversity,major,genomes,minor,genomes,major,genomics,minor,genomics,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronavirinae,minor,Coronavirinae,major,man,minor,man,major,Miniopterus pusillus,minor,Miniopterus pusillus,minor,Miniopterus fuliginosus,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,minor,Miniopterus,minor,Vespertilionidae,minor,Chiroptera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Du Jiang,Yang Li,Ren XianWen,Zhang JunPeng,Dong Jie,Sun LiLian,Zhu YaFang,Yang Fan,Zhang ShuYi,Wu ZhiQiang,Jin Qi,,,,Genetic diversity of coronaviruses in Miniopterus fuliginosus bats.,,,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20163209904&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20163209904,186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,604-614,614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand these processes, it is important to compare the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their respective hosts. In this study, we analysed more than 950 urine, faeces and oral swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species (Myotis nattereri, Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) for the presence of coronavirus, paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three different regions of Germany. Using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, we detected astrovirus sequences at an overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals, with a maximum of 65% in local populations. The detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were distinctly lower, ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%.

"Neurotropic viral infections. Volume 2: Neurotropic retroviruses, DNA viruses, immunity and transmission",,,,,2016,,,2016,,,Cham,Book chapter,"Recent studies have clearly shown that bats are the reservoir hosts of a wide diversity of novel viruses with representatives from most of the known animal virus families. In many respects bats make ideal reservoir hosts for viruses: they are the only mammals that fly, thus assisting in virus dispersal; they roost in large numbers, thus aiding transmission cycles; some bats hibernate over winter, thus providing a mechanism for viruses to persist between seasons; and genetic factors may play a role in the ability of bats to host viruses without resulting in clinical disease. Within the broad diversity of viruses found in bats are some important neurological pathogens, including rabies and other lyssaviruses, and Hendra and Nipah viruses, two recently described viruses that have been placed in a new genus, Henipaviruses in the family Paramyxoviridae. In addition, bats can also act as alternative hosts for the flaviviruses Japanese encephalitis and St Louis encephalitis viruses, two important mosquito-borne encephalitogenic viruses, and bats can assist in the dispersal and over-wintering of these viruses. Bats are also the reservoir hosts of progenitors of SARS and MERS coronaviruses, although other animals act as spillover hosts.

However, anthropogenic influences on the landscape and climate can change species assemblages and interactions, as well as undermine host-resilience. The cumulative result is a disturbance of bat-pathogen dynamics, which facilitate spillover events to sympatric species, and may threaten bat communities already facing synergistic stressors through ecological change. Therefore, characterisation of viral pathogens in bat communities provides important basal information to monitor and predict the emergence of diseases relevant to conservation and public health. This study used targeted molecular techniques, serological assays and next generation sequencing to characterise adenoviruses, coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses from 11 species of insectivorous bats within the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia.

In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n=624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n=254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P&lt;0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus 1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern.

The disease is characterized by encephalitic inflammation and is responsible for a number of annual fatal deaths of people and animals in the world. Chiropters such as insectivorous, frugivorous and hematophagous bats are the major transmitters, reservoirs, and vectors of the rabies virus. In Colombia, a total of thirty-five cases of human rabies occurred between 2000-2014. Of the thirty-five cases twenty-two were transmitted by bats. The genetic variant V3 (hematophagous bats) were responsible for 24 human deaths, while the genetic variant V4, carried by insectivorous bats, caused three human deaths. The disease is mainly linked to infected cats that may have hunted infected bats and then transmitted the virus to humans. Diagnosis is usually made by detection of the virus from infected animals and techniques such as RT-PCR, which might be used to promote active surveillance in bat populations. Rabies is a preventable disease and vaccination of pets confers protective immunity, however, vaccination coverage of pets in Colombia is still limited.

Communities in which bat guano is mined from caves have extensive exposure to bat excreta, often harvest bats for consumption, and are at risk for bat-borne diseases. Methods: This rapid ethnographic study was conducted in four provinces of Thailand (Ratchaburi, Sakaeo, Nakorn Sawan, and Phitsanulok), where bat guano was mined and sold during the period April-August 2014. The aim of this study was to understand behaviors and risk perceptions associated with bat conservation, exposure to bats and their excreta, and bat consumption. Sixty-seven respondents playing various roles in bat guano mining, packaging, sale, and use as fertilizer participated in the study. Data were collected through interviews and/or focus group discussions. Results: In spite of a bat conservation program dating back to the 1980s, the benefits of conserving bats and the risks associated with bat consumption were not clear and infrequently articulated by study respondents. Discussion: Since bat consumption continues, albeit covertly, the risk of bat-borne diseases remains high.

We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25th, 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus.

Masked palm civets were suspected as the origin of the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was confirmed as the direct origin of SARS cases with mild symptom in 2004. Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human SARS-CoV with nt identity over 99.6%, indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time. Alignment of 10 complete viral genome sequences from masked palm civets with those of human SARS-CoVs revealed 26 conserved single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the viruses from masked palm civets. These conserved SNVs were gradually lost from the genomes of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 SARS epidemic. In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as the natural reservoir of a group of coronaviruses that are distantly related to SARS-CoV. The genome sequences of bat SARS-like coronavirus had about 88-92% nt identity with that of the SARS-CoV. The prevalence of antibodies and viral RNA in different bat species and the characteristics of the bat SARS-like coronavirus were elucidated.

To start gaining information about bat-transmitted viruses in Hungary, we tested multiple bat species for several virus groups between 2012 and 2013. Materials and Methods: Fecal samples were collected from bats across Hungary. We performed group-specific RT-PCR screening for astro-, calici-, corona-, lyssa-, othoreo-, paramyxo-, and rotaviruses. Positive samples were selected and sequenced for further phylogenetic analyses. Results: A total of 447 fecal samples, representing 24 European bat species were tested. Novel strains of astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses were detected and analyzed phylogenetically. Out of the 447 tested samples, 40 (9%) bats were positive for at least one virus. Bat-transmitted astroviruses (BtAstV) were detected in eight species with a 6.93% detection rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.854, 9.571). Coronaviruses (BtCoV) were detected in seven bat species with a detection rate of 1.79% (95% CI 0.849, 3.348), whereas novel caliciviruses (BtCalV) were detected in three bat species with a detection rate of 0.67% (95% CI 0.189, 1.780). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a great diversity among astrovirus strains, whereas the Hungarian BtCoV strains clustered together with both alpha- and betacoronavirus strains from other European countries. One of the most intriguing findings of our investigation is the discovery of novel BtCalVs in Europe. The Hungarian BtCalV did not cluster with any of the calcivirus genera identified in the family so far. Conclusions: We have successfully confirmed BtCoVs in numerous bat species. Furthermore, we have described new bat species harboring BtAstVs in Europe and found new species of CalVs. Further long-term investigations involving more species are needed in the Central European region for a better understanding on the host specificity, seasonality, phylogenetic relationships, and the possible zoonotic potential of these newly described viruses.",major,carrier state,minor,carrier state,major,diagnostic techniques,minor,diagnostic techniques,major,health,minor,health,major,host specificity,minor,host specificity,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,molecular genetics,minor,molecular genetics,major,molecular taxonomy,minor,molecular taxonomy,major,new species,minor,new species,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,reverse transcriptase PCR,minor,reverse transcriptase PCR,major,reverse transcription,minor,reverse transcription,major,screening,minor,screening,major,seasonality,minor,seasonality,major,strains,minor,strains,major,taxonomy,minor,taxonomy,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Central Europe,minor,Central Europe,geo,Central Europe,major,Europe,minor,Europe,geo,Europe,major,Hungary,minor,Hungary,geo,Hungary,major,Astroviridae,minor,Astroviridae,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,man,minor,man,major,RNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,major,Rotavirus,minor,Rotavirus,major,viruses,minor,viruses,minor,biochemical genetics,minor,reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,minor,RT-PCR,minor,screening tests,minor,systematics,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,viruses,minor,Sedoreovirinae,minor,Reoviridae,minor,dsRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,Homo,"Kemenesi, G.","Dallos, B.","Görföl, T.","Boldogh, S.","Estók, P.","Kurucz, K.","Kutas, A.","Földes, F.","Oldal, M.","Németh, V.","Martella, V.","Bányai, K.","Jakab, F.",,"Molecular survey of RNA viruses in Hungarian bats: discovering novel astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses.",doi,10.1089/vbz.2014.1637,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20153031545&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20153031545,204,,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,Europe,minor,Nidovirales,minor,Central Europe,846-855,855,minor,Developed Countries,minor,European Union Countries,minor,OECD Countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Series B, Biological Sciences",2015,,,2015,282,1798,London,Journal Article,"Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.",major,animal ecology,minor,animal ecology,major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,disease vectors,minor,disease vectors,major,domestic animals,minor,domestic animals,major,emerging infectious diseases,minor,emerging infectious diseases,major,environmental factors,minor,environmental factors,major,epidemics,minor,epidemics,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,land use,minor,land use,major,livestock,minor,livestock,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,risk factors,minor,risk factors,major,spatial variation,minor,spatial variation,major,temporal variation,minor,temporal variation,major,vector-borne diseases,minor,vector-borne diseases,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronaviridae,minor,Coronaviridae,major,Ebolavirus,minor,Ebolavirus,major,Hendra virus,minor,Hendra virus,major,man,minor,man,major,Marburgvirus,minor,Marburgvirus,major,Nipah virus,minor,Nipah virus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,emerging diseases,minor,emerging infections,minor,viral infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Filoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,"Plowright, R.

To understand the background of bat viruses in Xinjiang, bat samples from 122 individuals were collected from two locations. Viral metagenomic analyses revealed that these bats carried 18 families of viruses, including phage, insect viruses, and vertebrate viruses. According to the results of viral metagenomics, a specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was undertaken for coronavirus, circovirus, astrovirus and parechovirus. As a result, their positive rates ranged from 1.3% to 10.5%. In particular, astroviruses exhibited rich genetic diversity with some showing high identity with porcine astroviruses (suggesting possible cross-species transmission), whereas parechovirus was discovered for the first time in bats.

A coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS, and initial assessments determined that the virus crossed to human hosts from zoonotic reservoirs, including bats, Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), sold in exotic animal markets in Guangdong Province. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern coronavirus cross-species transmission both in vitro and in vivo, using the emergence of SARS-CoV as a model. We pay particular attention to how changes in the Spike attachment protein, both within and outside of the receptor binding domain, mediate the emergence of coronaviruses in new host populations.",major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,recombination,minor,recombination,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,China,minor,China,geo,China,major,Guangdong,minor,Guangdong,geo,Guangdong,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronavirus,minor,Coronavirus,major,man,minor,man,major,Paguma larvata,minor,Paguma larvata,major,raccoon dogs,minor,raccoon dogs,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,genetic recombination,minor,Kwantung,minor,lung diseases,minor,People's Republic of China,minor,SARS,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,Paguma,minor,Viverridae,minor,Fissipeda,minor,carnivores,minor,Nyctereutes,minor,Canidae,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,East Asia,minor,Asia,minor,Central Southern China,minor,China,,,,,,,,,"Graham, R.

Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. If commonalities can be found, then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible.

,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2014,,,2014,88,17,Washington,Journal Article,"Bats are known to harbor emerging RNA viruses. Recent studies have used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify various virus species, including DNA viruses that are harbored by bats; however, little is known about the nature of these potentially novel viruses. Here, we report the characterization of a novel herpesvirus isolated from an Indonesian pteropodid bat. The virus, tentatively named fruit bat alphaherpesvirus 1 (FBAHV1), has a double-stranded DNA genome of 149,459 bp. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that FBAHV1 is phylogenetically grouped with simplexviruses within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Inoculation of FBAHV1 into laboratory mice caused a lethal infection. Virus infection was observed in lung, liver, and brain tissue. Serological and PCR screening revealed that fruit bats infected with FBAHV1 or its related virus are widely distributed in Indonesia. The identification of FBAHV1 makes a considerable contribution to our understanding of simplexviruses associated with bats. IMPORTANCE Bats are known to harbor emerging viruses, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, and filoviruses. Although alphaherpesviruses are disseminated in humans and other animals, there is little information about their distribution in bats. Here, we isolated a previously unknown alphaherpesvirus from an Indonesian fruit bat. Genome sequence analysis suggested that the virus is a member of the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which also includes common human viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the identification of pteropid bats (flying-foxes) as the natural host of the virus, and it is timely to reflect on a pivotal meeting of an eclectic group of scientists in that process. They included animal and public health experts, environmental scientists, veterinary and horse industry representatives, and wildlife experts. The task was to review and prioritise wildlife surveillance seeking the origin of the previously unknown virus. The group determined that the likely reservoir must occur in disparate locations, and be capable of moving between locations, or exist in continuous, overlapping populations spanning multiple locations. Flying-foxes were considered to be a more probable source of the novel virus than birds. Within weeks, antibodies were detected in several species of flying-fox, and the virus was subsequently isolated. While the identification of the natural host of Hendra virus within 18 months of its description was remarkable in itself, a broader legacy followed. In the subsequent years, a suite of zoonotic viruses including Australian bat lyssavirus, Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola and Marburg viruses have been detected in bats. Bats are now the ""go to"" taxa for novel viruses. History has repeatedly demonstrated that knowledge begets knowledge.

,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2017,,,2017,91,17,Washington,Journal Article,"Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which we denote Wénchéng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution. IMPORTANCE: The subfamily Coronavirinae contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in the viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (Wénchéng shrew virus [WESV]) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from those of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to those of any known viruses.

,,"""print""",7483007,,2008,,,2008,24,2,Oxford,Journal Article,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel human illness caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus (CoV) termed SARS-CoV. There are conflicting reports on the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV. Many of the groups that argue carnivores are the original reservoir of SARS-CoV use a phylogeny to support their argument. However, the phylogenies in these studies often lack outgroup and rooting criteria necessary to determine the origins of SARS-CoV. Recently, SARS-CoV has been isolated from various species of Chiroptera from China (e.g., Rhinolophus sinicus) thus leading to reconsideration of the original reservoir of SARS-CoV. We evaluated the hypothesis that SARS-CoV isolated from Chiroptera are the original zoonotic source for SARS-CoV by sampling SARS-CoV and non-SARS-CoV from diverse hosts including Chiroptera, as well as carnivores, artiodactyls, rodents, birds and humans. Regardless of alignment parameters, optimality criteria, or isolate sampling, the resulting phylogenies clearly show that the SARS-CoV was transmitted to small carnivores well after the epidemic of SARS in humans that began in late 2002. The SARS-CoV isolates from small carnivores in Shenzhen markets form a terminal clade that emerged recently from within the radiation of human SARS-CoV. There is evidence of subsequent exchange of SARS-CoV between humans and carnivores. In addition SARS-CoV was transmitted independently from humans to farmed pigs (Sus scrofa). The position of SARS-CoV isolates from Chiroptera are basal to the SARS-CoV clade isolated from humans and carnivores. Although sequence data indicate that Chiroptera are a good candidate for the original reservoir of SARS-CoV, the structural biology of the spike protein of SARS-CoV isolated from Chiroptera suggests that these viruses are not able to interact with the human variant of the receptor of SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In SARS-CoV we study, both visually and statistically, labile genomic fragments and, putative key mutations of the spike protein that may be associated with host shifts. We display host shifts and candidate mutations on trees projected in virtual globes depicting the spread of SARS-CoV. These results suggest that more sampling of coronaviruses from diverse hosts, especially Chiroptera, carnivores and primates, will be required to understand the genomic and biochemical evolution of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV.",major,cladistics,minor,cladistics,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,evolution,minor,evolution,major,genomes,minor,genomes,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,molecular genetics,minor,molecular genetics,major,mutations,minor,mutations,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,respiratory diseases,minor,respiratory diseases,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,viral proteins,minor,viral proteins,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Artiodactyla,minor,Artiodactyla,major,birds,minor,birds,major,carnivores,minor,carnivores,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Coronavirus,minor,Coronavirus,major,man,minor,man,major,pigs,minor,pigs,major,rodents,minor,rodents,major,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,biochemical genetics,minor,DNA sequences,minor,hogs,minor,lung diseases,minor,SARS,minor,swine,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,"Janies, D.","Habib, F.","Alexandrov, B.","Hill, A.","Pol, D.",,,,,,,,,,"Evolution of genomes, host shifts and the geographic spread of SARS-CoV and related coronaviruses.",doi,10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00199.x,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20083062894&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20083062894,226,,minor,viruses,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,Sus scrofa,minor,Sus,minor,Suidae,minor,Suiformes,minor,Artiodactyla,minor,Coronavirus,,,,,111-130,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zoonotic agents are RNA viruses (Genus Lyssavirus, Family Rhabdoviridae), global in distribution. As an acute, progressive, incurable encephalitis, rabies has the highest case fatality of any infectious disease. Warm-blooded vertebrates are susceptible hosts. Major mammalian reservoirs include mesocarnivores and bats. Given wildlife perpetuation, rabies is not eradicable, but is preventable and controllable, especially under newly available international guidelines. Areas covered: Literature review over the past 5 years reveals development of sensitive, specific diagnostic tests and safe and highly effective human and veterinary vaccines. Yet, tens of thousands of human fatalities occur annually, usually in Africa and Asia, primarily after canine exposure. Human and domestic animal vaccination, before or after exposure, is the single greatest preventative strategy following a rabid animal bite. Expert opinion: Significant progress occurred during the twenty-first century regarding vaccine development, doses, and schedules. Remaining barriers to widespread rabies vaccination include an inter-related set of economic, cultural, social, educational, ecological and technological factors.

A total of 58.9% of hedgehog fecal specimens were positive for the novel CoV (EriCoV) at 7.9 log10 mean RNA copies per ml. EriCoV RNA concentrations were higher in the intestine than in other solid organs, blood, or urine. Detailed analyses of the full hedgehog intestine showed the highest EriCoV concentrations in lower gastrointestinal tract specimens, compatible with viral replication in the lower intestine and fecal-oral transmission.

Appropriate public health and control measures will require discovery of the zoonotic MERS coronavirus reservoirs. The relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal MERS virus cell entry. Cell entry begins with virus spike (S) protein binding to DPP4 receptors. We constructed chimeric DPP4 receptors that have the virus-binding domains of indigenous Middle Eastern animals and assessed the activities of these receptors in supporting S protein binding and virus entry. Human, camel, and horse receptors were potent and nearly equally effective MERS virus receptors, while goat and bat receptors were considerably less effective. These patterns reflected S protein affinities for the receptors. However, even the low-affinity receptors could hypersensitize cells to infection when an S-cleaving protease(s) was present, indicating that affinity thresholds for virus entry must be considered in the context of host-cell proteolytic environments. These findings suggest that virus receptors and S protein-cleaving proteases combine in a variety of animals to offer efficient virus entry and that several Middle Eastern animals are potential reservoirs for transmitting MERS-CoV to humans. IMPORTANCE: MERS is a frequently fatal disease that is caused by a zoonotic CoV. The animals transmitting MERS-CoV to humans are not yet known. Infection by MERS-CoV requires receptors and proteases on host cells. We compared the receptors of humans and Middle Eastern animals and found that human, camel, and horse receptors sensitized cells to MERS-CoV infection more robustly than goat and bat receptors. Infection susceptibility correlated with affinities of the receptors for viral spike proteins. We also found that the presence of a cell surface lung protease greatly increases susceptibility to MERS-CoV, particularly in conjunction with low-affinity receptors.

Herein, we studied the relationship between ectoparasitic infections with the wing mite (Spinturnix myoti) and the size of the breeding colonies, sex, age, and body condition index (BCI) of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The influence of environmental quality in the Carpathian Mountains (Poland) was also examined. We found significant differences in mite abundance and BCI between different breeding aggregations of the greater mouse-eared bat and also between the host sex/age categories. The most heavily infected bats were adult M. myotis females, while young males appeared to be the least infected. The BCI differed significantly between the sexes in young bats (males had a higher BCI than females) and also between colonies. No significant differences in the BCI were found for adult females. We did not find any relationship between the infestation rate of M. myotis, their colony size, the quality of environmental resources (percentage of forest cover around the colony), or the BCI. The prevalence of the various developmental stages of the mites did not differ between the host sex/age categories; however, differences were found in the sex ratios of deutonymphs and adult mites between adult M. myotis females.

,,"""print""",14712164,BMC Genomics,2012,,,2012,13,261,London,Journal Article,"Background: Bats are the natural reservoir host for a range of emerging and re-emerging viruses, including SARS-like coronaviruses, Ebola viruses, henipaviruses and Rabies viruses. However, the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood and there is little information available on any aspect of antiviral immunity in bats. Massively parallel sequencing of the bat transcriptome provides the opportunity for rapid gene discovery. Although the genomes of one megabat and one microbat have now been sequenced to low coverage, no transcriptomic datasets have been reported from any bat species. In this study, we describe the immune transcriptome of the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing an important resource for identification of genes involved in a range of activities including antiviral immunity. Results: Towards understanding the adaptations that have allowed bats to coexist with viruses, we have de novo assembled transcriptome sequence from immune tissues and stimulated cells from P. alecto. We identified about 18,600 genes involved in a broad range of activities with the most highly expressed genes involved in cell growth and maintenance, enzyme activity, cellular components and metabolism and energy pathways. 3.5% of the bat transcribed genes corresponded to immune genes and a total of about 500 immune genes were identified, providing an overview of both innate and adaptive immunity. A small proportion of transcripts found no match with annotated sequences in any of the public databases and may represent bat-specific transcripts. Conclusions: This study represents the first reported bat transcriptome dataset and provides a survey of expressed bat genes that complement existing bat genomic data. In addition, these data provide insight into genes relevant to the antiviral responses of bats, and form a basis for examining the roles of these molecules in immune response to viral infection.",major,enzyme activity,minor,enzyme activity,major,enzymes,minor,enzymes,major,genes,minor,genes,major,genomes,minor,genomes,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,immunity,minor,immunity,major,immunogenetics,minor,immunogenetics,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,rabies,minor,rabies,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,viral regulatory proteins,minor,viral regulatory proteins,major,viral replication,minor,viral replication,major,Australia,minor,Australia,geo,Australia,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Ebolavirus,minor,Ebolavirus,major,Henipavirus,minor,Henipavirus,major,Pteropus alecto,minor,Pteropus alecto,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,DNA sequences,minor,Ebola virus,minor,SARS,minor,APEC countries,minor,Australasia,minor,Oceania,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,Developed Countries,minor,OECD Countries,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Filovirus,minor,Filoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Paramyxovirinae,minor,Paramyxoviridae,minor,Pteropus,minor,Pteropodidae,minor,Chiroptera,,,,,,,"Papenfuss, A.

We combined computing applications, molecular detection, and nucleotide sequencing of coronaviruses, hantaviruses, paramyxoviruses and pegiviruses with ecological and phylogenetic analyses. A total of 22 viruses were discovered in 1,067 samples from 42 bat species, representing an estimated 78% of all viral richness in the system. Based on 17 virus genotypes discovered with an equal sampling effort, a total viral richness of 23 genotypes was estimated using a Chao2 statistic model. Using a residual model, we categorized host species and habitat types that are prone to harboring higher viral richness. Positive relationships were found between phylogenetic host diversity and both viral diversity (r=0.41, p&lt;0.05) and viral richness (r=0.51, p&lt;0.05). The beta diversity (the rate of change) of viral communities was explained by host beta diversity (r=0.86, p&lt;0.05). To understand the change in viral and host communities, we partitioned beta diversity in nestedness (species loss) and turnover (compositional dissimilarity) components. In Chiapas, the host beta diversity was explained by the nestedness of species composition, while the phylogenetic host diversity was explained by turnover of the host lineages. Campeche showed a high phylogenetic host nestedness and low host turnover. Beta-diversity and beta-phylogenetic diversity indicated that patterns of local species assemblages and regional abiotic features in human-dominated landscapes are significant drivers of viral community composition.

,,"""print""",15303667,Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases,2006,,,2006,6,4,New Rochelle,Journal Article,"Bats classified in the order Chiroptera are the most abundant and widely distributed non-human mammalian species in the world. Several bat species are reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses and therefore can be a public health hazard. Lyssaviruses of different genotypes have emerged from bats in America (Genotype 1 rabies virus; RABV), Europe (European bat lyssavirus; EBLV), and Australia (Australian bat lyssavirus; ABLV), whereas Nipah virus is the most important recent zoonosis of bat origin in Asia. Furthermore, some insectivorous bat species may be important reservoirs of SARS coronavirus, whereas Ebola virus has been detected in some megachiropteran fruit bats. Thus far, European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) is the only zoonotic virus that has been detected in bats in Europe. New zoonotic viruses may emerge from bat reservoirs and known ones may spread to a wider geographical range. To assess future threats posed by zoonotic viruses of bats, there is a need for accurate knowledge of the factors underlying disease emergence, for an effective surveillance programme, and for a rapid response system. In Europe, primary efforts should be focussed on the implementation of effective passive and active surveillance systems for EBLVs in the Serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, and Myotis species (i.e., M. daubentonii and M. dasycneme) Apart from that, detection methods for zoonotic viruses that may emerge from bats should be implemented. Analyses of data from surveillance studies can shed more light on the dynamics of bat viruses, (i.e., population persistence of viruses in bats). Subsequently, studies will have to be performed to assess the public health hazards of such viruses (i.e., infectivity and risk of infection to people).

,,"""print""",21507511,mBio,2013,,,2013,4,5,Washington,Journal Article,"Coronaviruses are known to infect humans and other animals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here we report the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States and determination of its origin, evolution, and genotypes based on temporal and geographical evidence. Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of PEDV isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three U.S. strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese PEDV strains and their likely Chinese origin. The U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent U.S. strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV. Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the PED outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent U.S. PEDV strains share unique genetic features at the 5′-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission. The data from this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in the United States and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures against PEDV. IMPORTANCE: The sudden emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus, for the first time in the United States causes significant economic and public health concerns. Since its recognition in May 2013, PEDV has rapidly spread across the United States, resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 States now. The ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula and the historical deadly nature of the 2002 outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus create further anxiety over the emergence of PEDV in the United States due to the lack of scientific information about the origin and evolution of this emerging coronavirus.

It is recommended that the presence of the bats be reduced in buildings or houses since they harbour rabies, leptospirosis and histoplasmosis. Some recommendations on how to deter their presence in the buildings are to identify access sites of bats to their shelter, repair and plug cracks and internal or external openings in buildings, replace broken or cracked glass windows in work centres and homes, place barriers in small openings so as to prevent the entrance of bats and install light fixtures in dark areas of the buildings. Infections caused by bats can be minimized by cleaning and disinfecting bat droppings and urine, covering and storing food and water properly, and extermination of rats and insects since these animals serve as prey of the bats. It is also wise to carry out health checks to people who work and live in places with evident bat infestation, educate people about the bats and participate in radio and TV programmes which provide information about the benefits and harmful effects caused by M. molossus.

The first is a mandatory vaccination of the dogs against rabies, which has been proven effective in eliminating human rabies cases in particular countries, and the second is the oral vaccination (ORV) of foxes against rabies, which is the best method for the eradication of the rabies virus in natural habitats, with exception of bats. In the Republic of Croatia, the mandatory vaccination of dogs against rabies was initiated in 1948, and only two years later urban rabies was successfully eradicated. More than 40 years (1991) have passed until the programme of the ORV of foxes against rabies was introduced. Within that period, considerable efforts have been made to hunt foxes (culling, poisoning or gassing in fox dens), with the goal to keep the population of foxes on the level of 4 per 1 km2 or below. The programme of ORV of foxes against rabies in the Republic of Croatia started for the first time in 1991, and it lasted until 1996, when it was discontinued due to lack of financial resources and the War in Croatia. For the second time, it started again in 1998, but it covered only the city of Zagreb and Zagreb County, and it was discontinued for the same reasons as before. For the third time, ORVprogramme started in 2010, when the autumn campaign of dropping baits was performed, while in 2011 two actions of dropping baits (spring and autumn) were performed on the entire area of the Republic of Croatia. The results of the oral rabies vaccination (ORV) program targeting foxes in the period 2010-2015 were outstanding: while there were 11.1% positive rabies isolates in domestic animals and wildlife in 2010, this number by 2015 was reduced to 0%.

Nowadays, there are several descriptions about the presence of S. aureus and/or MRSA in different animal species (dogs, sheep, donkeys, bats, pigs, and monkeys), and in food of animal origin in African countries.

Bat NGOs throughout Europe have worked to persuade the public not to handle bats or to do so only with gloved hands and, in the case of bat workers, to receive pre-exposure immunization. They have also countered negative media coverage of bat rabies. Householders with bat roosts in their dwellings have in general been persuaded to retain their bats. Attempts have been made to persuade all European countries to establish comparable EBLV surveillance programmes.

,,"""print""",17498848,CAB Reviews,2019,,,2019,14,53,Wallingford,FRFF,"This systematic review focuses on the nematode genus Toxocara and its zoonotic and non-zoonotic species and provides an update to that published by Warren almost half a century ago. Currently, 26 species of Toxocara have been described morphologically and four differentiated by molecular techniques. The most frequently reported and wide spread zoonotic species is Toxocara canis. Zoonotic infection with T. cati remains controversial and only a few infections, mostly in children with ocular larval migrans (OLM), have been reported. To date, none have been confirmed using molecular techniques. Only a single-suspected case of human infection with T. pteropodis has been reported and this species has yet to be confirmed as zoonotic. Of the non-zoonotic species T. vitulorum is of major economic importance and there are 13 minor species: T. alienata, T. apodemi, T. genettae, T. indica, T. leonine, T. mackerrasae, T. malaysiensis, T. paradoxura, T. pearsei, T. sprenti, T. surkattae, T. tanuki and T. vajrasthirae. Nine species have been reported only once: T. canarisi, T. cynonycteridis, T. elephantis, T. herpestum, T. hippopotami, T. lyncis, T. manzadiensis, T. vincenti and T. warreni. Toxocara occurs in many definitive host species: canids, felids, civets, mongoose, cattle, raccoons, bats and rodents. In humans, T. canis infections can result in four distinct syndromes: visceral larval migrans, OLM, neuro-toxocariasis and covert toxocariasis. Serological tests supplemented by molecular and imaging techniques provide the basis of diagnosis and may also add to the longitudinal monitoring of treatment. Seroprevalence in humans in developed countries ranges from 3 to 22% and in developing countries from 10 to 92%. Vertical transmission of the parasite in definitive hosts facilitates the earliest potential production of eggs from young animals and provides challenging yet important control opportunities. Climate change and increasing human and companion animal populations have facilitated an expansion in the geographical range of this zoonosis. Behavioural changes coupled with increased urbanization enhance potential transmission, as people and dogs become increasingly crowded together facilitating opportunities for T. canis transmission, and a greater understanding of these factors should be examined to facilitate appropriate and cost-effective control programmes. Anthelminthic used in the elimination of adult parasites from dog or cat intestines can provide an effective control with toxocariasis. Control measures using a one health approach coordinating the expertise of physicians, veterinarians, public health workers, dog owners and aided by legislation facilitates a best practice approach to control.",major,animal parasitic nematodes,minor,animal parasitic nematodes,major,climate change,minor,climate change,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,helminthoses,minor,helminthoses,major,helminths,minor,helminths,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,infections,minor,infections,major,nematode infections,minor,nematode infections,major,parasites,minor,parasites,major,parasitoses,minor,parasitoses,major,toxocariasis,minor,toxocariasis,major,urbanization,minor,urbanization,major,vertical transmission,minor,vertical transmission,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,cats,minor,cats,major,cattle,minor,cattle,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,dogs,minor,dogs,major,man,minor,man,major,mongooses,minor,mongooses,major,Procyon lotor,minor,Procyon lotor,major,Toxocara,minor,Toxocara,major,Toxocara canis,minor,Toxocara canis,major,Toxocara cati,minor,Toxocara cati,major,Toxocara genettae,minor,Toxocara genettae,major,Toxocara pteropodis,minor,Toxocara pteropodis,major,Toxocara vitulorum,minor,Toxocara vitulorum,minor,animal-parasitic nematodes,minor,climatic change,minor,nematode parasites of animals,minor,nematodes,minor,nematodes of animals,minor,parasitic diseases,minor,parasitic infestations,minor,parasitic worms,minor,parasitosis,minor,raccoons,minor,toxocarosis,minor,urbanisation,minor,zoonotic infections,"Ziegler, M.

Zoonotic transmission of EVD requires contact between susceptible human hosts and the reservoir species for Ebolaviruses, which are believed to be fruit bats. Nevertheless, features of the landscape that may facilitate such points of contact have not yet been adequately identified. Nor have spatial dependencies between zoonotic EVD transmission and landscape structures been delineated. This investigation sought to describe the spatial relationship between zoonotic EVD transmission events, or spillovers, and population density and vegetation cover. An inhomogeneous Poisson process model was fitted to all precisely geolocated zoonotic transmissions of EVD in West and Central Africa. Population density was strongly associated with spillover; however, there was significant interaction between population density and green vegetation cover. In areas of very low population density, increasing vegetation cover was associated with a decrease in risk of zoonotic transmission, but as population density increased in a given area, increasing vegetation cover was associated with increased risk of zoonotic transmission. This study showed that the spatial dependencies of Ebolavirus spillover were associated with the distribution of population density and vegetation cover in the landscape, even after controlling for climate and altitude. While this is an observational study, and thus precludes direct causal inference, the findings do highlight areas that may be at risk for zoonotic EVD transmission based on the spatial configuration of important features of the landscape.",major,altitude,minor,altitude,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,landscape,minor,landscape,major,mortality,minor,mortality,major,population density,minor,population density,major,risk,minor,risk,major,vegetation,minor,vegetation,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Central Africa,minor,Central Africa,geo,Central Africa,major,West Africa,minor,West Africa,geo,West Africa,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Ebolavirus,minor,Ebolavirus,major,man,minor,man,minor,death rate,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Africa South of Sahara,minor,Africa,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Filoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Walsh, M.

Over the past few years, research work has looked into factors that may lead to super-spreading events, clinical/laboratory parameters that may differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia, the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome, reservoir host distribution and transmission routes. A better understanding of these issues may help prevent and control future outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Recent findings: Bats are natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses. The human and civet isolates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome has the potential of being converted from droplet to airborne transmission. When evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low absolute neutrophil count on presentation, along with poor responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment, may raise the index of suspicion for severe acute respiratory syndrome. Summary: The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats raises the possible role of bats in previous and potentially future severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in human.

,,"""print""",24507393,Journal of Veterinary Research,2019,,,2019,63,4,Warsaw,Journal Article,"Introduction: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) identifies random viral fragments in environmental samples metagenomically. High reliability gains it broad application in virus evolution, host-virus interaction, and pathogenicity studies. Deep sequencing of field samples with content of host genetic material and bacteria often produces insufficient data for metagenomics and must be preceded by target enrichment. The main goal of the study was the evaluation of HTS for complete genome sequencing of field-case rabies viruses (RABVs). Material and Methods: The material was 23 RABVs isolated mainly from red foxes and one European bat lyssavirus-1 isolate propagated in neuroblastoma cells. Three methods of RNA isolation were tested for the direct metagenomics and RABV-enriched approaches. Deep sequencing was performed with a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) and reagent v3 kit. Bioinformatics data were evaluated by Kraken and Centrifuge software and de novo assembly was done with metaSPAdes. Results: Testing RNA extraction procedures revealed the deep sequencing scope superiority of the combined TRIzol/column method. This HTS methodology made it possible to obtain complete genomes of all the RABV isolates collected in the field. Significantly greater rates of RABV genome coverages (over 5,900) were obtained with RABV enrichment. Direct metagenomic studies sequenced the full length of 6 out of 16 RABV isolates with a medium coverage between 1 and 71. Conclusion: Direct metagenomics gives the most realistic illustration of the field sample microbiome, but with low coverage.

This study aimed to describe the range of bat viromes, including viruses from mammals, insects, fungi, plants, and phages, in 11 insectivorous bat species (216 bats in total) common in six provinces of China. To analyze viromes, we used sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina). The viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons to known viruses. The mammalian viruses included those of the Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Retroviridae, Circoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Astroviridae, Flaviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Parvovirinae; insect viruses included those of the Baculoviridae, Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tetraviridae, and Densovirinae; fungal viruses included those of the Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Totiviridae; and phages included those of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, and Microviridae and unclassified phages. In addition to the viruses and phages associated with the insects, plants, and bacterial flora related to the diet and habitation of bats, we identified the complete or partial genome sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses. These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these novel viruses showed little genetic similarity with previously reported viruses.

Nevertheless, despite their prevalence in natural systems, parasites have been examined less often than other organisms traditionally used for testing hypotheses of community assembly. In the present study, we investigate possible effects of competitive interactions on patterns of distribution (co-occurrence) and density among a group of streblid bat flies parasitic on short-tailed fruit bats, Carollia perspicillata. Using null model analyses of species co-occurrence, we did not find evidence that competition affects the distribution of bat fly species across hosts. Moreover, when non-infested hosts were included, analyses showed evidence for interspecific aggregation, rather than for the segregation predicted by competition theory. Partial Pearson correlations among bat fly species densities showed no evidence of negative covariation in two of three cases. In the species pair for which a significant negative correlation was found, a visual analysis of plotted covariation indicated a constraint line, suggesting that competition between these two species might become operational only in some infracommunities when abundances of bat flies approach a maximum set by one or more limiting resources. Moreover, when a community-wide estimation of the significance of density compensation was calculated, the result was not significant. Overall, we find no evidence that competition influences the distribution of bat flies on their hosts, and mixed support for effects of competition on the densities of species. These results are consistent with the idea that competition plays a role in structuring natural communities, but in many systems its effects are context-dependent and might not be important relative to other factors. Wider analyses across taxonomic and environmental gradients and a detailed consideration of the different hypothesized effects of competition are necessary to fully understand the importance of competition on natural communities.",major,animal ecology,minor,animal ecology,major,density dependent selection,minor,density dependent selection,major,ectoparasites,minor,ectoparasites,major,interspecific competition,minor,interspecific competition,major,occurrence,minor,occurrence,major,species,minor,species,major,USA,minor,USA,geo,USA,major,Carollia,minor,Carollia,major,Carollia perspicillata,minor,Carollia perspicillata,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Hippoboscidae,minor,Hippoboscidae,major,Phyllostomidae,minor,Phyllostomidae,major,Streblidae,minor,Streblidae,minor,United States of America,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Diptera,minor,insects,minor,Hexapoda,minor,arthropods,minor,invertebrates,minor,Chiroptera,minor,Phyllostomidae,minor,Carollia,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developed Countries,minor,North America,minor,America,minor,OECD Countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tello, J.

Here, we report the isolation, cell tropism, and complete genome sequence of a novel betaherpesvirus from the bat Miniopterus schreibersii (MsHV). In primary cell culture, MsHV causes cytopathic effects (CPE) and reaches peak virus production 2 weeks after infection. MsHV was found to infect and replicate less efficiently in a feline kidney cell, CRFK, and failed to replicate in 13 other cell lines tested. Sequencing of the MsHV genome using the 454 system, with a 224-fold coverage, revealed a genome size of 222,870 bp. The genome was extensively analyzed in comparison to those of related viruses. Of the 190 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), 40 were identified as herpesvirus core genes. Among 93 proteins with identifiable homologues in tree shrew herpesvirus (THV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), or rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV), most had highest sequence identities with THV counterparts. However, the MsHV genome organization is colinear with that of RCMV rather than that of THV. The following unique features were discovered in the MsHV genome. One predicted protein, B125, is similar to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) U94, a homologue of the parvovirus Rep protein. For the unique ORFs, 7 are predicted to encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related proteins, 2 to encode MHC class I homologues, and 3 to encode MHC class II homologues; 4 encode the homologues of C-type lectin- or natural killer cell lectin-like receptors;, and the products of a unique gene family, the b149 family, of 16 members, have no significant sequence identity with known proteins but exhibit immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domains revealed by three-dimensional (3D) structural prediction.

The spread of infectious diseases is facilitated by the semi-synanthropic way of life of Chiroptera, creation of multiple colonies and migration flights. The immune system also enables viral replication and persistence of the pathogen in the population. Among the several viruses isolated from members of the Chiropteran order, those of great zoonotic importance are rabies virus and related lyssavirus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.

Natural history of vampire bats.,,,,,1988,,,1988,,,"Boca Raton, Florida 33431",Book,"Before the 1930s, when vampire bats became a veterinary public health problem in Panama and Trinidad, knowledge of these bats was only fragmentary. During the past 50 years a large amount of knowledge has accumulated, mostly about the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, and particularly directed towards their control. Until now the information on vampire bats has been scattered throughout the literature or is not recorded. This book covers the different aspects of the natural history of vampire bats. There are 17 chapters, covering the following topics: introduction to the natural history; systematics and distribution; paleontology; genetics; anatomy; locomotion; social organization and behaviour; reproduction; feeding behaviour; salivary antihaemostatic factors; orientation and sensory function; transmission of pathogenic microorganisms; parasites; economic losses due to D. rotundus; control; care in captivity; man, gods and legendary vampire bats.",major,Disease transmission,minor,Disease transmission,major,Rabies,minor,Rabies,major,Wild animals,minor,Wild animals,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,minor,vampire bats,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Natural history of vampire bats.,,,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=19902207355&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,19902207355,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,246 pp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,editor,"Schmidt, U.",print,849367506,editor,"Schmidt, U.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,editor,"Greenhall, A.

NiV outbreaks have been reported in the Malay Peninsula, Bangladesh and India. In Malay Peninsula, NiV was transmitted by the fruit bat, the natural host, through swine to humans, creating a threat in both public health and animal health. In Bangladesh, NiV has been transmitted directly from fruit bats to humans and, in some cases, from humans to humans. Epidemiological conditions differ in the two regions, due in part to societal background. To prevent zoonoses - infectious diseases transmitted from a nonhuman animal to a human - such as NiV infection, measures must be taken covering two different aspects; first, against infection originating in wild animals and, second, against infection derived from domestic animals. In wild hosts, chances for the pathogen to move from hosts to humans must be minimized.

,,"""print""",19926197,Global Veterinaria,2010,,,2010,4,1,Faisalabad,Journal Article,"This review reports on why is there still rabies in the world? - an emerging microbial and global health threat. Rabies remains an important public health issue in the world. While rabies has been controlled throughout most of the developed world, it remains a significant burden in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. Although industrialized countries have been able to contain recent outbreaks, many resource-limited and transitioning countries have not been able to react adequately. Although, a vaccine-preventable disease, the annual number of human deaths caused by rabies is estimated to be 35,000 per year, mostly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Though, dogs have been identified as being primarily responsible for the transmission of rabies in human and other domestic animals, known pathogenesis and available data suggest that all or nearly all cases of human rabies attributable to bats were transmitted by bat bites that were minimized or unrecognized by the patients. One of the key for controlling rabies is to focus on the animal reservoir. The high incidence of rabies in some country led numerous concerns attributed to a potential carrier-dog phenomenon, undocumented transmission of rabies virus from wildlife to dogs, counterfeit vaccines, vaccine mismatching and seroconversion testing in patients after their completion of postexposure prophylaxis. However, the number of reported human rabies cases, particularly in Africa, greatly underestimates the true effects of the disease. Contributing factors include failure to seek treatment at healthcare facilities, failure to make a laboratory diagnosis and failure to report the disease. The disconnection between human and dog rabies in developing world reflects a lack of awareness of the concept of one medicine, or health without regard to species, in approaches to rabies control in the public health system. Another factor contributing to the endemicity of rabies in the world could be attributed to low vaccine coverage. Although there are many factors that contribute to the epidemic or endemic nature of rabies in the world, the single most important factor is the failure to immunize domestic dogs, which transmit rabies to humans. Regional and local disease resurgence occurs, due in part to a combination of political and economic instability, environmental perturbations and shifting government priorities. Indeed rabies is a widely distributed zoonotic disease of major public-health importance and an emerging as well as re-emerging microbial and global health threat but a preventable problem. Surveillance strategies for rabies and other rabies-related viruses in the world, particularly Africa must be improved to better understand the epidemiology of this virus and to make informed decisions on future vaccine strategies.",major,aetiology,minor,aetiology,major,control programmes,minor,control programmes,major,disease control,minor,disease control,major,disease distribution,minor,disease distribution,major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease surveys,minor,disease surveys,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,pathogenesis,minor,pathogenesis,major,public health,minor,public health,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,vaccination,minor,vaccination,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Africa,minor,Africa,geo,Africa,major,Developing Countries,minor,Developing Countries,geo,Developing Countries,major,Nigeria,minor,Nigeria,geo,Nigeria,major,Canidae,minor,Canidae,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,dogs,minor,dogs,major,man,minor,man,major,Rabies virus,minor,Rabies virus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,causal agents,minor,control programs,minor,disease surveillance,minor,etiology,minor,Third World,minor,Underdeveloped Countries,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Fissipeda,minor,carnivores,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Canis,minor,Canidae,minor,Homo,"Okonko, I.

Recently, we and another group independently identified several horseshoe bat species (genus Rhinolophus) as the reservoir host for a large number of viruses that have a close genetic relationship with the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our current research focused on the identification of the reservoir species for the progenitor virus of the SARS coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks during 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. In addition to SARS-like coronaviruses, many other novel bat coronaviruses, which belong to groups 1 and 2 of the 3 existing coronavirus groups, have been detected by PCR. The discovery of bat SARS-like coronaviruses and the great genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats have shed new light on the origin and transmission of SARS coronaviruses.",major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,outbreaks,minor,outbreaks,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,severe acute respiratory syndrome,minor,severe acute respiratory syndrome,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Coronavirus,minor,Coronavirus,major,man,minor,man,major,Rhinolophus,minor,Rhinolophus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,SARS,minor,SARS coronavirus,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Coronaviridae,minor,Nidovirales,minor,positive-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Rhinolophidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,Coronavirus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wang LinFa,Shi ZhengLi,Zhang ShuYi,"Field, H.","Daszak, P.","Eaton, B.

,,,,,2019,,,2019,,,São Paulo,Thesis,"Rabies is a viral disease, with a high mortality rate, that is mainly transmitted by the domestic dogs and the hematophagous bat, Desmodus rotundus. Despite the prevention and control actions, it is still endemic in Peru. The main objectives of the present work were the description of human and animal rabies in Peru, as well as the development of a predictive model of transmission of rabies virus in livestock. The official national reports of cases and outbreaks of human and animal rabies between the years 2001 to 2017 were used. The results indicated that human cases of rabies mainly occur as a consequence of the wild cycle, that are presented with higher frequency in the Amazonian regions. While dog cases of rabies have suffered a recent increase due to the outbreak of the disease in Southern Peru. On the other hand, the outbreaks of bovine rabies were frequent over the years being distributed particularly along the inter-Andean valleys and Amazonian regions of Peru. Additionally, the risk of rabies transmission from hematophagous bats to bovines was estimated through the adaptation of a receptivity and vulnerability model based on decision trees, for the development of a predictive model of bovine rabies by districts. The official data of outbreaks of the disease in bovines and the information on environmental alterations were used as covariates. The density of livestock and the geomorphological characteristics of each district were obtained through the last national livestock census and the geographic information systems available. The model was validated through the evaluation of some scenarios that were conceived from different cut points of the receptivity variables compared to the information of the outbreaks from the last 6 years, in order to find the most suitable degree of prediction for the occurrence of rabies outbreaks by district. Among the main conclusions, is the importance of maintainance of the national policies of prevention and health promotion of human and animal rabies in Peru. Moreover, the developing of new intervention criteria that prioritize the ecology of the transmitters of the virus to the susceptible populations, which may represent a better option than other preventive measures that haven't had the expected success. Finally, the proposed bovine rabies prediction model, despite being dependent on the information generated by the epidemiological surveillance of the disease, represents an interesting tool to optimize its functioning at national level.",major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,domestic animals,minor,domestic animals,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,livestock,minor,livestock,major,outbreaks,minor,outbreaks,major,prediction,minor,prediction,major,rabies,minor,rabies,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Peru,minor,Peru,geo,Peru,major,Desmodus rotundus,minor,Desmodus rotundus,major,man,minor,man,major,Rabies virus,minor,Rabies virus,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,Desmodus,minor,Phyllostomidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,primates,minor,Andean Group,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,Latin America,minor,America,minor,South America,minor,Lyssavirus,minor,Rhabdoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ulloa-Stanojlovic, F.

Bats were captured during 2 sessions (each was five-day long), the first started on 31 December 2000 and the second on 13 January 2001. The survey covered a predominantly agricultural area (disturbed), and an area dominated by semideciduous dry forest (undisturbed). A total of 151 non-haematophagous bats (16 species) were captured from the two areas. Fifty-six (37%) had anti-rabies antibodies (Ab), while 87 (58%) did not, and 8 samples (5%) had to be discarded because of haemolysis. A much lower (P&lt;0.05) prevalence of anti-rabies Ab was found in bats caught in disturbed areas (22.7%) compared with those from undisturbed areas (51.9%). The presence of anti-rabies Ab was not related to sex, genera or feeding habits. The higher prevalence found in bats in the undisturbed area may be the result of more frequent interspecies encounters. Of the 108 sera analysed for antibodies against LPMV, only one was positive (a male Rhogeessa parvula major, captured in the undisturbed area). This suggests that bats in the surveyed localities do not play a role in the epidemiology of LPMV.",major,antibodies,minor,antibodies,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,serological surveys,minor,serological surveys,major,seroprevalence,minor,seroprevalence,major,Mexico,minor,Mexico,geo,Mexico,major,Chiroptera,minor,Chiroptera,major,Paramyxoviridae,minor,Paramyxoviridae,major,rabies virus,minor,rabies virus,minor,La Piedad Michoacan virus,minor,Rhogeessa parvula major,minor,seroepidemiology,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Lyssavirus,minor,Rhabdoviridae,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,Latin America,minor,America,minor,North America,minor,OECD Countries,minor,Threshold Countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Salas-Rojas, M.","Sánchez-Hernández, C.","Romero-Almaraz, M. de L.","Schnell, G.

,,,,Parasites and Vectors,2020,,,2020,13,181,London,Journal Article,"Background: Leishmaniasis is a human and animal disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, which is now divided into four subgenera, Leishmania, Viannia, Sauroleishmania and Mundinia. Subgenus Mundinia, established in 2016, is geographically widely dispersed, its distribution covers all continents, except Antarctica. It consists of 5 species; L. enriettii and L. macropodum are parasites of wild mammals while L. martiniquensis, L. orientalis and an unnamed Leishmania sp. from Ghana are infectious to humans. There is very little information on natural reservoir hosts and vectors for any Mundinia species. Methods: Experimental infections of guinea pigs with all five Mundinia species were performed. Animals were injected intradermally with 107 culture-derived promastigotes into both ear pinnae. The courses of infections were monitored weekly; xenodiagnoses were performed at weeks 4 and 8 post-infection using Lutzomyia migonei. The distribution of parasites in different tissues was determined post-mortem by conventional PCR. Results: No significant differences in weight were observed between infected animals and the control group. Animals infected with L. enriettii developed temporary lesions at the site of inoculation and were infectious to Lu. migonei in xenodiagnoses. Animals infected with L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis developed temporary erythema and dry lesions at the site of inoculation, respectively, but were not infectious to sand flies. Guinea pigs infected by L. macropodum and Leishmania sp. from Ghana showed no signs of infection during experiments, were not infectious to sand flies and leishmanial DNA was not detected in their tissue samples at the end of experiments at week 12 post-inoculation. Conclusions: According to our results, guinea pigs are not an appropriate model organism for studying Mundinia species other than L. enriettii. We suggest that for better understanding of L.

Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. Results: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified. Conclusion: This extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the stepwise evolution of different functional proteins of SARS-CoVs at different epidemic stages and different hosts.

Moreover, the layered landscape epidemiology surrounding spillover from reservoir host species to humans is ill-defined. Identifying landscape features that contribute to NiV spillover would likely prove helpful in preventing emergence in human populations. Methods: Using an inhomogeneous Poisson model, this study investigated the role of vegetation cover, the human footprint (HFP) and reservoir Pteropus bat distribution to identify the spatial dependence of spillover and map risk across South and Southeast Asia. Results: The spatial model identified HFP (RR=1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.11) and bat distribution (RR=19.44; 95% CI 1.92-196.7) as significant predictors of NiV risk, while vegetation cover was not significant after accounting for HFP and the presence of Pteropus bats. Conclusions: These findings further inform the landscape epidemiology of NiV and suggest specific conduits for spillover in the landscape.

These hazards include Salmonella, Toxoplasma, Trichinella and Mycobacterium in farmed wild boar and deer. An epidemiological indicator is defined as the prevalence or concentration of the hazard at a certain stage of the food chain or an indirect measure of the hazard that correlates to the human health risk caused by the hazard. The indicators can be used by the European Commission and Member States to consider when adaptations in meat inspection methods may be relevant and to carry out risk analysis to support such decisions. It is foreseen that the indicators will be used in the revised meat inspection system for farmed game meat outlined in the European Food Safety Authority scientific opinion, particularly to help categorise slaughter batches, animals and slaughterhouses according to the risk related to the hazards and process hygiene or to enable surveillance for the possible emergence of the hazard. Depending on the purpose and the epidemiological situation, risk managers should decide on the most appropriate indicator(s) to use, either alone or in combination, at national, regional, slaughterhouse or farm/herd level. Member States are invited to report data generated by the implementation of the indicators in accordance with Directive 2003/99/EC.

,,"""print""",1664302X,Frontiers in Microbiology,2019,,,2019,10,February,Lausanne,Journal Article,"Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Choleraesuis is a swine adapted serovar. S. Choleraesuis variant Kunzendorf is responsible for the majority of outbreaks among pigs. S. Choleraesuis is rare in Europe, although there have been serious outbreaks in pigs including two outbreaks in Denmark in 1999-2000 and 2012-2013. Here, we elucidate the epidemiology, possible transmission routes and sources, and clonality of European S. Choleraesuis isolates including the Danish outbreak isolates. A total of 102 S. Choleraesuis isolates from different European countries and the United States, covering available isolates from the last two decades were selected for whole genome sequencing. We applied a temporally structured sequence analysis within a Bayesian framework to reconstruct a temporal and spatial phylogenetic tree. MLST type, resistance genes, plasmid replicons, and accessory genes were identified using bioinformatics tools. Fifty-eight isolates including 11 out of 12 strains from wild boars were pan-susceptible. The remaining isolates carried multiple resistance genes. Eleven different plasmid replicons in eight plasmids were determined among the isolates. Accessory genes were associated to the identified resistance genes and plasmids. The European S. Choleraesuis was estimated to have emerged in ~1837 (95% credible interval, 1733-1983) with the mutation rate of 1.02 SNPs/genome/year. The isolates were clustered according to countries and neighbor countries. There were transmission events between strains from the United States and European countries. Wild boar and pig isolates were genetically linked suggesting cross-border transmission and transmission due to a wildlife reservoir. The phylogenetic tree shows that multiple introductions were responsible for the outbreak of 2012-2013 in Denmark, and suggests that poorly disinfected vehicles crossing the border into Denmark were potentially the source of the outbreak. Low levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) differences (0-4 SNPs) can be observed between clonal strains isolated from different organs of the same animal. Proper disinfection of livestock vehicles and improved quality control of livestock feed could help to prevent future spread of S.

In this study, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene of raccoon dog (rdACE2) was cloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of rdACE2 has identities of 99.3, 89.2, 83.9 and 80.4% to ACE2 proteins from dog, masked palm civet (pcACE2), human (huACE2) and bat, respectively. There are six amino acid changes in rdACE2 compared with huACE2, and four changes compared with pcACE2, within the 18 residues of ACE2 known to make direct contact with the SARS-CoV S protein. A HeLa cell line stably expressing rdACE2 was established; Western blot analyses and an enzyme-activity assay indicated that the cell line expressed ACE2 at a similar level to two previously established cell lines that express ACE2 from human and masked palm civet, respectively. Human immunodeficiency virus-backboned pseudoviruses expressing spike proteins derived from human SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like viruses of masked palm civets and raccoon dogs were tested for their entry efficiency into these cell lines. The results showed that rdACE2 is a more efficient receptor for human SARS-CoV, but not for SARS-CoV-like viruses of masked palm civets and raccoon dogs, than huACE2 or pcACE2.

,,"""print""",489697,Science of the Total Environment,2020,,,2020,733,,Oxford,Journal Article,"Quantitative information relating sewerage infrastructure schemes to microbial water quality improvements in recreational and shellfish harvesting areas is lacking. In this study, we assessed the effect of two sewerage schemes on concentrations of faecal indicator organisms (FIO) in Chichester Harbour, an important oyster fishery and water recreation area in the UK. The sewerage schemes comprised the installation of activated sludge and UV disinfection plants and increase in the storage capacity of storm tanks at sewage treatment works that discharge to tidal waters. Analysis of FIO data covering the period 2007-2018 indicated log-order reductions in FIO concentrations in the harbour after the sewerage schemes, which was reflected by better compliance with the E. coli and enterococci limits for ""excellent"" of the Bathing Waters Directive. Mean concentrations of E. coli in shellfish reduced ≤0.5 log10 and compliance of commercial shellfish beds with the limits of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 either maintained or upgraded to class B status during the 11-year period. However, compliance with the guideline E. coli standard of the Shellfish Water Protected Areas Directions was not consistently achieved. We suggest that better harmonisation of monitoring practices used in the various statutory programmes would help in understanding if the observed discrepancy in FIO compliance between waters and shellfish is due to actual pollution levels at compliance sites or other factors.

These zoonotic retroviruses establish lifelong persistent infection in their human hosts. SFV are apparently nonpathogenic in vivo, with ubiquitous in vitro tropism. Here, we aimed to identify envelope B-cell epitopes that are recognized following a zoonotic SFV infection. We screened a library of 169 peptides covering the external portion of the envelope from the prototype foamy virus (SFVpsc_huHSRV.13) for recognition by samples from 52 Central African hunters (16 uninfected and 36 infected with chimpanzee, gorilla, or Cercopithecus SFV). We demonstrate the specific recognition of peptide N96-V110 located in the leader peptide, gp18LP. Forty-three variant peptides with truncations, alanine substitutions, or amino acid changes found in other SFV species were tested. We mapped the epitope between positions 98 and 108 and defined six amino acids essential for recognition. Most plasma samples from SFV-infected humans cross-reacted with sequences from apes and Old World monkey SFV species. The magnitude of binding to peptide N96-V110 was significantly higher for samples of individuals infected with a chimpanzee or gorilla SFV than those infected with a Cercopithecus SFV.

,,"""print""",10806040,,2012,,,2012,18,1,Atlanta,Correspondence,"525 tissue samples collected from 417 bats (representing 28 genera) in western and central Africa, during 2009 and early 2011, were tested for the presence of hantavirus RNA. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples and reverse transcribed. cDNA was screened by polymerase chain reaction specific for sequences of the large genomic segment across the genus Hantavirus. One sample, which was obtained from Nycteris hispida in Sierra Leone, yielded a product of the expected size and was subjected to cloning and sequencing. The obtained 414-nt sequence covered a genomic region corresponding to nt position 2918-3332 in the large segment open reading frame of prototypic Hantaan virus. Bioinformatic analysis on the amino acid level showed highest degrees of identity to shrew and mole associated hantaviruses (Thottapalayam virus 73.0%, Altai virus 69.7%, Nova and Imjin virus 69.3%). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the sequence was grouped with hantaviruses found in shrews and moles. Since the new amino acid sequence was at least 22% divergent from those of other hantaviruses, it is concluded that the bat was infected with a newly found hantavirus. A putative name Magboi virus (MGBV) was proposed for the new virus because it was detected in an animal captured at Magboi River in Sierra Leone. The study results suggest that bats, which are hosts of many emerging pathogens, may act as natural reservoirs for hantavirus.",major,amino acid sequences,minor,amino acid sequences,major,bioinformatics,minor,bioinformatics,major,molecular taxonomy,minor,molecular taxonomy,major,new species,minor,new species,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,open reading frames,minor,open reading frames,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,phylogeny,minor,phylogeny,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,RNA,minor,RNA,major,Sierra Leone,minor,Sierra Leone,geo,Sierra Leone,major,Hantavirus,minor,Hantavirus,major,Nycteris hispida,minor,Nycteris hispida,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,DNA sequences,minor,Magboi virus,minor,ORFs,minor,protein sequences,minor,ribonucleic acid,minor,Bunyaviridae,minor,negative-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Nycteris,minor,Nycteridae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,ACP Countries,minor,Anglophone Africa,minor,Africa,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,Least Developed Countries,minor,Developing Countries,minor,West Africa,minor,Africa South of Sahara,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weiss, S.","Witkowski, P.

,,"""print""",0022538X,Journal of Virology,2015,,,2015,89,15,Washington,Journal Article,"Bats are important reservoirs for several viruses, many of which cause lethal infections in humans but have reduced pathogenicity in bats. As the innate immune response is critical for controlling viruses, the nature of this response in bats and how it may differ from that in other mammals are of great interest. Using next-generation transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq), we profiled the transcriptional response of Pteropus vampyrus bat kidney (PVK) cells to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus known to elicit a strong innate immune response in mammalian cells. The Pteropus genus is a known reservoir of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Analysis of the 200 to 300 regulated genes showed that genes for interferon (IFN) and antiviral pathways are highly upregulated in NDV-infected PVK cells, including genes for beta IFN, RIG-I, MDA5, ISG15, and IRF1. NDV-infected cells also upregulated several genes not previously characterized to be antiviral, such as RND1, SERTAD1, CHAC1, and MORC3. In fact, we show that MORC3 is induced by both IFN and NDV infection in PVK cells but is not induced by either stimulus in human A549 cells. In contrast to NDV infection, HeV and NiV infection of PVK cells failed to induce these innate immune response genes. Likewise, an attenuated response was observed in PVK cells infected with recombinant NDVs expressing the NiV IFN antagonist proteins V and W. This study provides the first global profile of a robust virus-induced innate immune response in bats and indicates that henipavirus IFN antagonist mechanisms are likely active in bat cells. IMPORTANCE: Bats are the reservoir host for many highly pathogenic human viruses, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses, and many other viruses have also been isolated from bats. Viral infections are reportedly asymptomatic or heavily attenuated in bat populations. Despite their ecological importance to viral maintenance, research into their immune system and mechanisms for viral control has only recently begun. Nipah virus and Hendra virus are two paramyxoviruses associated with high mortality rates in humans and whose reservoir is the Pteropus genus of bats. Greater knowledge of the innate immune response of P. vampyrus bats to viral infection may elucidate how bats serve as a reservoir for so many viruses.",major,genes,minor,genes,major,immune response,minor,immune response,major,immunity,minor,immunity,major,interferon,minor,interferon,major,messenger RNA,minor,messenger RNA,major,pathogenicity,minor,pathogenicity,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,transcriptomes,minor,transcriptomes,major,Hendra virus,minor,Hendra virus,major,Nipah virus,minor,Nipah virus,major,Pteropus vampyrus,minor,Pteropus vampyrus,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,immunity reactions,minor,immunological reactions,minor,mRNA,minor,Henipavirus,minor,Paramyxovirinae,minor,Paramyxoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Pteropus,minor,Pteropodidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Glennon, N.

,,"""print""",10806040,,2008,,,2008,14,2,Atlanta,Correspondence,"Bats are thought to be one of the most important reservoirs for viruses such as Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Ebola virus. These pathogens became known after extensive surveys of bats following outbreaks. As a first step in investigating unidentified pathogens in bats and to help forecast the potential threat of emerging infectious diseases, an attempt was made to isolate and characterize viruses that persistently infect bats. Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae, or Ryukyu flying fox, is a fruit bat of Japan. With the permission of the governor of Okinawa, one adult male bat of this species was caught for this study. The spleen and kidneys were used to establish primary cell cultures. On the 4th passage of the primary adherent cells derived from the spleen, a cytopathic effect (CPE) appeared without any visible microbe, indicating that the cell culture contained a virus. The virus, tentatively named Ryukyu virus 1 (RV1), caused apparent CPE on primary kidney cells derived from a Ryukyu flying fox and on our established bat kidney T1 (BKT1) cells, which were derived from the kidney of a horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and transformed with expression plasmid DNA encoding the large T antigen of replication origin-defective simian virus 40. Rapid determination of viral RNA (RDV) system version 1.0 was used for identification. However, no viral nucleic acid sequence was detected from an RNA sample in the RV1-infected BKT1 cells. A system for rapid determination of viral DNA sequences (RDV-D) by minor modification to the RDV system for RNA viruses was developed for the detection of viral DNA. Two of the fragments were homologous to the gene encoding the precursor of terminal protein (pTP) of adenoviruses. Further RDV-D analysis showed that 6 fragments (139 bp, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. AB302970) were homologous to the pTP gene and that another 6 fragments (316 bp, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. AB302971) were homologous to the gene encoding the precursor of protein VI (pVI) of adenoviruses. These results indicated that RV1 must belong to the family Adenoviridae. PCR and sequencing were performed for confirmation. Sequence analysis of the amplified product (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. AB303301) showed that RV1 was homologous to tree shrew adenovirus 1 (70.0% amino acid sequence identity), porcine adenovirus 5 (69.2%), canine adenovirus 1 (68.9%), human adenoviruses 3, 16, 21 and 50 (68.9%), and other viruses (&gt;64.8%) in genus Mastadenovirus, but less homologous (46.7%-57.8%) to viruses in other genera, Siadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, and Atadenovirus. In addition, a phylogenic tree based on amino acid sequences indicated that RV1 belongs to family Adenoviridae, genus Mastadenovirus. In conclusion, a novel virus was isolated from a fruit bat. This virus was isolated from a healthy bat, which suggests that the virus may persistently infect fruit bats. Although its pathogenicity for humans is still unknown, knowledge of RV1 will be useful in epidemiological studies of infectious diseases emerging from bats because persistently infecting viruses might be isolated together with primary pathogens.",major,disease transmission,minor,disease transmission,major,genes,minor,genes,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,identification,minor,identification,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,phylogenetics,minor,phylogenetics,major,polymerase chain reaction,minor,polymerase chain reaction,major,reservoir hosts,minor,reservoir hosts,major,Japan,minor,Japan,geo,Japan,major,Adenoviridae,minor,Adenoviridae,major,Human adenovirus,minor,Human adenovirus,major,man,minor,man,major,Pteropus,minor,Pteropus,major,Rhinolophus ferrumequinum,minor,Rhinolophus ferrumequinum,minor,animal reservoirs,minor,DNA sequences,minor,PCR,minor,Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae,minor,dsDNA viruses,minor,DNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Mastadenovirus,minor,Adenoviridae,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Pteropodidae,minor,Chiroptera,minor,Rhinolophus,minor,Rhinolophidae,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developed Countries,minor,East Asia,minor,Asia,minor,OECD Countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maeda, K.","Hondo, E.","Terakawa, J.","Kiso, Y.","Nakaichi, N.","Endoh, D.","Sakai, K.","Morikawa, S.","Mizutani, T.",,,,,,Isolation of novel adenovirus from fruit bat (Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae).,,,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20083057195&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20083057195,299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,347-349,349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a theoretical case study, we compared the impacts of two different HeV prevention strategies - vaccination and flying fox roost removal - using a recently developed framework that considers different stakeholder group perspectives. The perspectives of the four selected stakeholder groups regarding intangibles were inferred from public discussions and coverage in the media. For all stakeholder groups, the option to vaccinate horses was found to add value to the economic results when the intangible impacts were included in the analysis, while the option for roost removal unanimously detracted from economic analysis value when the intangible impacts were included. Both the mean and median stakeholder-adjusted value ratios (2.25 and 2.12, respectively) for vaccination were inflated when intangible impacts were included, by value-adding to the results of a traditional economic analysis. In the roost removal strategy, these ratios (1.19 and 1.16, respectively) were deflated when intangible impacts were included. Results of this theoretical study suggest that the inclusion of intangible impacts promotes the value of a two-dose initial vaccination protocol using a subunit vaccination considered to offer complete protection for horses, as a strategy to control HeV, whereas roost removal becomes an even more costly strategy. Outcome of the analysis is particularly sensitive to the intangible value placed on human health.

,,"""print""",1681702,Virus Research,2005,,,2005,111,1,Oxford,Journal Article,"The direct fluorescent antibody test is a sensitive and specific procedure used in the routine diagnosis of rabies. However, given the critical role of the rabies diagnostic laboratory in patient management and public health decision-making, the use of a standardized national rabies diagnostic procedure is highly recommended. Seemingly small variations in test procedures may have dramatic effects on sensitivity. For example, two independent reports of diminished staining performance of two lots of a commercial anti-rabies conjugate were investigated in this study. The diminished staining occurred only with a single rabies-virus variant, associated with big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, in the southwestern United States. Similarly diluted and prepared diagnostic reagents provided bright staining on all other variants of rabies-virus tested. Subsequent evaluation disclosed that the phenomenon was associated with the relative concentrations of glycerol used in the mounting media by the reporting laboratories. These findings, related to the proper selection of an optimal cover-glass mountant for use in the immunofluorescence procedure, demonstrate the potential for erroneous results with severe implications for patient health, when uncontrolled variations in protocol occur.

A widespread HPAI vaccination campaign that started at the end of 2005 in Viet Nam resulted in the cessation of poultry and human cases, but in 2006/2007 severe HPAI outbreaks re-emerged. In this study we investigated the pattern of this first post-vaccination epidemic in southern Viet Nam identifying a spatio-temporal cluster of outbreak occurrence and estimating spatially smoothed incidence rates of HPAI. Spatial risk factors associated with HPAI occurrence were identified. Medium-level poultry density resulted in an increased outbreak risk (Odds ratio (OR)=5.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-18.9) but also climate-vegetation factors played an important role: medium-level normalised difference vegetation indices during the rainy season from May to October were associated with higher risk of HPAI outbreaks (OR=3.7, 95% CI: 1.7-8.1), probably because temporal flooding might have provided suitable conditions for the re-emergence of HPAI by expanding the virus distribution in the environment and by enlarging areas of possible contacts between domestic waterfowl and wild birds. On the other hand, several agricultural production factors, such as sweet potatoes yield, increased buffalo density, as well as increased electricity supply were associated with decreased risk of HPAI outbreaks. This illustrates that preventive control measures for HPAI should include a promotion of low-risk agricultural management practices as well as improvement of the infrastructure in village households.

Such routine surveillance may prove insufficient to elucidate the main drivers of fecal pollution in a complex lake/watershed ecosystem, and it may be that more comprehensive monitoring activities are required. In this study, the aims were to identify the hotspots and main driving factors of fecal pollution in a large shallow Central European lake, the Neusiedler See, and to determine to what degree its current monitoring network can be considered representative spatially. A stochastic and geostatistical analysis of a huge data set of water quality data (~164,000 data points, representing a 22-year time-series) of standard fecal indicator bacteria (SFIB), water quality and meteorological variables sampled at 26 sampling sites was conducted. It revealed that the hotspots of fecal pollution are exclusively related to sites with elevated anthropogenic activity. Background pollution from wildlife or diffuse agricultural run-off at more remote sites was comparatively low. The analysis also showed that variability in the incidence of SFIB was driven mainly by meteorological phenomena, above all, temperature, number of sunny hours, and wind (direction and speed). Due to antagonistic effects and temporal undersampling, the influence of precipitation on SFIB variance could not be clearly determined. Geostatistical analysis did reveal that the current spatial sampling density is insufficient to cover SFIB variance over the whole lake, and that the sites are therefore in the most part representative of local phenomena. Suggestions for the future monitoring and managing of fecal pollution are offered.

Insect control agents are based on different microorganisms, which should be stably effective against target pest organism. There are different origins of industrial strains including isolation from natural objects, screening of collections, selection of existing strains, genetic engineering etc. but in all cases beneficial features of the strains should be preserved. In this article, the problems of preserving beneficial features of insecticidal bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (BTH14) are discussed. This strain is effective as the pest control agent against larvae of mosquitoes, midges and rice and champignons mosquitoes. Different methods and time of storage of various BTH14 strains are shown: 266/2 on meat-peptone agar (MPA) and in corpse of mosquitoes for one year, in sodium chloride crystals for one and a half year; 71 on MPA without reseeding for one year and for two years with reseeding every six months; 87a by cryopreservation for ten years; 87, 404, 19/43 as lyophilized bacteria for 28 years; 7-1/23, 71/82, 19/1 in sodium chloride crystals for 27 years. Culture of BTH14 strain was grown on MPA slants at 28-30°C for 5-7 days until reaching the complete formation of spores and endotoxin crystals. Microscopic analysis was carried out with aniline black dye. Morphological analysis of colonies was performed with colony-purified BTH14. When BtH14 was stored by the lyophilization method, the spore culture in a tube on a slant MPA was washed with 5 ml of a 20% NaCl solution. Then 0.5 ml of the resulting suspension with a titer of 107-108 CFU/ml was added with a Pasteur pipette into glass ampoules, covered with a sterile swab, then sterile stopper and frozen in a cold bath at a temperature of -22°C for 1 hour, dried at -45°C for 23 hours, sealed under vacuum over a gas burner and stored in a refrigerator at 3-5°C. When using the BtH14 storage method in NaCl crystals, 5 ml of 0.9% saline was added to a tube with spore culture on slant MPA, resuspended, and 0.5 ml of suspension was added to sterile tubes, covered with cotton-gauze stoppers and stored at room temperature. When BtH14 was stored by cryopreservation, the spore culture of BtH14 was suspended in meat-peptone broth (MBP) with 10% glycerol. The resulting suspensions (200 µl each) were poured into cryovials and stored at -80°C. The BtH14 titer and larvicidal activity for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were measured once or twice per year. The results showed that the culture of the 266/2 strain after a year of storage in the corpses of mosquitoes Culex pipiens molestus or on MPA dissociated with the formation of 0.8 and 1.6% of the IV S form morphotype which lost activity against A. aegypti mosquitoes. The titer of the spores and the larvicidity of the 71 strain were at the initial level after one year of storage on MPA in tubes with paraffinized plugs when reseeded every 6 months. These indicators decreased, respectively, by 12 and 16% in a year and by 25-27% after 2 years of storage. Cryopreservation of the 87a strain provided stability of titer and larvicidal activity after 10 years. Thus, the initial titer and larvicidal activity expressed as LC50 for A. aegypti mosquitoes were 2.74×109 CFU/ml and 0.178×10-3%, respectively. After 6 and 10 years, they corresponded to the following indicators: 2.82×109 CFU/ml and 0.19×10-3%; 2.72×109 CFU/ml and 0.18×10-3%. The BtH14 strains 7-1/23, 71/82, and 19/1 were stored in NaCl crystals. After 27 years of storage, their titers and LC50 for A. aegypti mosquitoes varied within the range of 3.12×109-3.52×109 CFU/ml and 0.135×10-3-0.150×10-3% as compared to the initial values that were 3.98×109-4.29×109 CFU/ml and 0.10×10-3-0.11×10-3%, respectively.

,,"""print""",19352727,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2016,,,2016,10,8,San Francisco,Journal Article,"Background: Infection by the simian malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, can lead to severe and fatal disease in humans, and is the most common cause of malaria in parts of Malaysia. Despite being a serious public health concern, the geographical distribution of P. knowlesi malaria risk is poorly understood because the parasite is often misidentified as one of the human malarias. Human cases have been confirmed in at least nine Southeast Asian countries, many of which are making progress towards eliminating the human malarias. Understanding the geographical distribution of P. knowlesi is important for identifying areas where malaria transmission will continue after the human malarias have been eliminated. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 439 records of P. knowlesi infections in humans, macaque reservoir and vector species were collated. To predict spatial variation in disease risk, a model was fitted using records from countries where the infection data coverage is high. Predictions were then made throughout Southeast Asia, including regions where infection data are sparse. The resulting map predicts areas of high risk for P. knowlesi infection in a number of countries that are forecast to be malaria-free by 2025 (Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam) as well as countries projected to be eliminating malaria (Myanmar, Laos, Indonesia and the Philippines). Conclusions/Significance: We have produced the first map of P. knowlesi malaria risk, at a fine-scale resolution, to identify priority areas for surveillance based on regions with sparse data and high estimated risk. Our map provides an initial evidence base to better understand the spatial distribution of this disease and its potential wider contribution to malaria incidence.

This 14-month project and subsequent research have resulted in the collection of many species of plants and animals, indicating that Batu Apoi is richer in species than might be expected from its size. New species of virtually every group of plants and animals have been identified. Many of the plant and animal species are used by the Iban tribesmen, who, thanks to an enactment that prohibits guns in Brunei, hunt employing traditional methods such as traps, snares and spears. A variety of plants are purported to possess pharmaceutical properties, according to local beliefs, many of which do not have botanical names. With revenue generated from overseas investments, besides oil and gas production, Brunei Darussalam is in the position of being perhaps one of few countries that has relatively large areas under rain forest cover, but does not need to exploit its forest for timber export.

During this epidemic, 28.500 cases and 11.315 deaths have been reported. Our review covers the period 1976-2016 and summarizes available literature on previous and current Ebola outbreaks, clinical findings, laboratory diagnosis, mode of transmission, and the local or regional epizootic. In 1976, the first two cases of simultaneous Ebola outbreaks were identified in Sudan and Zaire. According to the known data the virus is fatal among non-human primates. The animal reservoir, the amplification host and other intermediate hosts are not yet clear. The virus has been detected in the dogs and the fruit bats in central Africa. It has been also experimentally inoculated in fruit and free tailed bats. The longer lasting dry seasons in the deforested areas of Western Africa along with the behavioral patterns of wild animals, facilitate the dissemination of the virus from wild life to humans. The ways in which the Ebola virus is transmitted among human populations are the direct contact with infected bats or primates, the contact with human blood or body fluids (mainly during the ritual burials), the contaminated objects of the patients or syringes contaminated by the fluids of the patients (hospital dissemination). In the case of outbreaks among humans, the main difficulty of the local health authorities or the international medical expeditions into the field, was the wasting of time until the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The laboratory investigation focuses on reverse transcriptase PCR, keeping the ELISA for cross checking and cross-sectional prevalence studies.

It is a mosquito-borne zoonotic virus with a bi-directional transmission route from animal to human and vice versa, and causes neurological disorders such as meningoencephalitis in bats, Homo sapiens, birds and horses. Due to limited availability of information about USUV and its deleterious effects on neural cells causing neurologic impairments, it becomes imperative to study this virus in detail to equip ourselves with a solution beforehand. The current study aims to identify immunodominant peptides that could be exploited in future for designing global peptide vaccine for combating the infections caused by USUV. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was applied to evaluate the immunogenicity of 7 non-structural proteins and determined 64 continuous B-cell epitopes, numerous probable discontinuous B-cell epitopes, 64 MHC Class-I binders, 126 MHC class-II binders and 52 promiscuous binders with a maximum population coverage of 98.55%(MHC Class-I binder of YP_164815.1 NS4a) and 81.81% (MHC Class-II binders of YP_164812.1 NS2a, YP_164813.1 NS2b, YP_164814.1 NS3, YP_164817.1 NS4b, YP_164818.1 NS5).

Excluding other ticks imported on exotic pets and zoo animals, another 13 tick species are listed that may occur, at least occasionally, in Sweden. Because of its wide geographic distribution, great abundance and wide host range, I. ricinus is medically the most important arthropod in northern Europe. I. ricinus is common in southern and south-central Sweden and along the coast of northern Sweden and has been recorded from 29 mammal species, 56 bird species, and 2 species of lizards in Sweden alone. The potential introduction to Sweden of exotic pathogens with infected ticks (e.g. I. persulcatus and H. marginatum on birds or Dermacentor spp. and R. sanguineus on mammals) is evident.",major,disease vectors,minor,disease vectors,major,distribution,minor,distribution,major,ecology,minor,ecology,major,ectoparasites,minor,ectoparasites,major,geographical distribution,minor,geographical distribution,major,hosts,minor,hosts,major,introduced species,minor,introduced species,major,new geographic records,minor,new geographic records,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,Europe,minor,Europe,geo,Europe,major,Sweden,minor,Sweden,geo,Sweden,major,Acari,minor,Acari,major,Arachnida,minor,Arachnida,major,Argasidae,minor,Argasidae,major,birds,minor,birds,major,Carios vespertilionis,minor,Carios vespertilionis,major,Dermacentor variabilis,minor,Dermacentor variabilis,major,Haemaphysalis punctata,minor,Haemaphysalis punctata,major,Hyalomma aegyptium,minor,Hyalomma aegyptium,major,Hyalomma marginatum,minor,Hyalomma marginatum,major,Ixodes arboricola,minor,Ixodes arboricola,major,Ixodes canisuga,minor,Ixodes canisuga,major,Ixodes hexagonus,minor,Ixodes hexagonus,major,Ixodes lividus,minor,Ixodes lividus,major,Ixodes persulcatus,minor,Ixodes persulcatus,major,Ixodes ricinus,minor,Ixodes ricinus,major,Ixodes trianguliceps,minor,Ixodes trianguliceps,major,Ixodes uriae,minor,Ixodes uriae,major,Ixodidae,minor,Ixodidae,major,mammals,minor,mammals,major,reptiles,minor,reptiles,major,Rhipicephalus sanguineus,"Jaenson, T.

The reservoir area is situated in the closed zone and its recreational use is forbidden. Despite the fact, so called wild beaches occur in the areas distant from the dam and their use may lead to bacteriological contamination of water in the reservoir. Bacteriological analysis covered the ten-year period (2004-2014) during which water samples were collected from a single point located in the middle of the reservoir in place of water extraction for the water supply for Krosno city citizens. On the basis of the results obtained from the Voivodship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Rzeszów, analyses were conducted for the bacteria from coli group, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Salmonella bacteria. Water bacteriological quality was assessed in compliance with the current regulations of the Minister of Health and Minister of Environment. The time trend for changeability of the bacteria count was determined for the analyzed period. Only in one month (October 2008) water in the reservoir did not meet the requirements posed for waters in watering places and sites used for bathing. Over the whole period of the research the water was suitable for potable water supply to people, however in different years it required various treatment processes, adequate for water quality categories A1 and A2. For safety reasons, the monitoring procedures for the Besko reservoir should be upgraded, because during the analyzed period, the studied series of mean contents of the analyzed water contamination indices in the reservoir water revealed an upward trend for the bacteria from coli group and a significant upward trend for the Enterococci.

A clear, analytical distinction between proteins from wheat flour, egg white, or egg yolk has been a main challenge. However, this can be addressed by using egg proteins carrying 15N. Therefore, egg white and yolk protein were enriched in 15N by mixing 15N-labeled leucine into hen feed. Incorporation of egg and flour proteins in the protein network was monitored based on changes in their extractability during cake making. The relative contribution of different noncovalent and covalent bonds could be determined by using different extraction media. We for the first time distinguished between the contribution of egg white, egg yolk, and wheat protein in network formation during pound cake making. Our results show that during batter mixing hardly any intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed and that baking induces tremendous changes in protein extractability. A protein network based on both disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions is formed during baking.

Sea-algae extract was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'), and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011. In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sea-algae extract in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 28 November 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier the Seaweed Task Force and on 24 February 2011 to the Member States for consultation and comments. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on sea-algae extract. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of sea-algae extract as a plant growth regulator on beans, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis the following Annex II data gaps were identified: melting point, boiling point, temperature of decomposition, vapour pressure, Henry's law constant, spectra, solubility in water, solubility in organic solvents, octanolwater partition co-efficient, hydrolysis, photolysis, quantum yield and dissociation constant. For the formulations low temperature stability, dilution stability before and after accelerated storage, and shelf-life studies were identified as data gaps. Data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section regarding information on the uses allowing to waive toxicological studies for the species Macrocystis integrifolia, and for medical data on the three species Ascophyllum nodosum, Laminaria digitata and Macrocystis integrifolia. No areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the residue section. No areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the environmental fate and behaviour section. The risk to birds and mammals and to aquatic organisms was assessed as low. However, a data gap was identified for further data and risk assessment for algae from an additional taxonomic group and for aquatic plants. Moreover, it was noted that the composition of the batches of the formulations used in the aquatic tests did not comply with the representative batches. A data gap was also identified for a risk assessment for honeybees referring to one of the representative uses where exposure of bees could occur.

In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by France, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of oryzalin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) concerning the non-inclusion of oryzalin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Dow AgroSciences made a resubmission application for the inclusion of oryzalin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of oryzalin as a herbicide on wine grapes and table grapes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the physical/chemical properties section no critical areas of concern were identified. A data gap to address the explosive properties was identified. Two data gaps and one critical area of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. The data gaps are related to the assessment of the toxicological relevance of groundwater metabolites and impurities. The area of concern is the fact that the batches used in the toxicological studies were not demonstrated to be representative of the technical specification. Based on the metabolism study performed on grape, the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as oryzalin alone. MRLs were proposed at the LOQ (0.01* mg/kg) for table and wine grape. No chronic concern was identified, the TMDI being less than 1% of the ADI for all diets included in the EFSA PRIMo model. Oryzalin exhibits moderate to very high persistence in soil under aerobic conditions. Metabolite OR-20 exhibits low to moderate persistence in soil. Oryzalin may be considered medium to low mobile in soil and metabolite OR-20 may be considered to be highly or very highly mobile in soil. Data gaps have been identified for degradation and adsorption parameters for metabolites OR-13 and OR-15. The 80th percentile annual average 1 m depth leachate concentration was calculated for oryzalin and metabolite OR-20 for the use in vines. Oryzalin and metabolite OR-20 exceeded the limit of 0.1 µg/L in one of the seven scenarios. The risk to the aquatic environment was assessed as high. Even with risk mitigation comparable to a no-spray buffer zone of 10 m, no full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger. The risk assessment for birds and mammals covers only application to bare soil. A high risk to herbivorous birds and mammals and bees can not be excluded if vegetation is present in-field during the time of application. The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil-dwelling macro- and micro-organisms, non-target plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",major,absorption,minor,absorption,major,air,minor,air,major,analytical methods,minor,analytical methods,major,classification,minor,classification,major,environment,minor,environment,major,environmental impact,minor,environmental impact,major,excretion,minor,excretion,major,exposure,minor,exposure,major,food contamination,minor,food contamination,major,food safety,minor,food safety,major,grapes,minor,grapes,major,groundwater,minor,groundwater,major,herbicide residues,minor,herbicide residues,major,herbicides,minor,herbicides,major,labelling,minor,labelling,major,metabolism,minor,metabolism,major,metabolites,minor,metabolites,major,oryzalin,minor,oryzalin,major,physicochemical properties,minor,physicochemical properties,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,risk,minor,risk,major,risk assessment,minor,risk assessment,major,sediment,minor,sediment,major,soil,minor,soil,major,surface water,minor,surface water,major,tissue distribution,minor,tissue distribution,major,toxicity,minor,toxicity,major,toxicology,minor,toxicology,major,uses,minor,uses,major,Vitidaceae,minor,Vitidaceae,major,Vitis,minor,Vitis,minor,analytical techniques,minor,environmental effects,minor,food contaminants,minor,labeling,minor,labels,European Food Safety Authority,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance oryzalin.,,,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20103360964&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20103360964,315,Journal Article,minor,Vitaceae,minor,weedicides,minor,weedkillers,minor,Vitidaceae,minor,Rhamnales,minor,dicotyledons,minor,angiosperms,minor,Spermatophyta,minor,plants,minor,eukaryotes,,,,,Article 1707,Article 1707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"""print""",15689883,Harmful Algae,2018,,,2018,79,,Oxford,Journal Article,"Some diatoms of the genera Pseudo-nitzschia and Nitzschia produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), a compound that caused amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) in humans just over 30 years ago (December 1987) in eastern Canada. This review covers new information since two previous reviews in 2012. Nitzschia bizertensis was subsequently discovered to be toxigenic in Tunisian waters. The known distribution of N. navis-varingica has expanded from Vietnam to Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Australia. Furthermore, 15 new species (and one new variety) of Pseudo-nitzschia have been discovered, bringing the total to 52. Seven new species were found to produce DA, bringing the total of toxigenic species to 26. We list all Pseudo-nitzschia species, their ability to produce DA, and show their global distribution. A consequence of the extended distribution and increased number of toxigenic species worldwide is that DA is now found more pervasively in the food web, contaminating new marine organisms (especially marine mammals), affecting their physiology and disrupting ecosystems. Recent findings highlight how zooplankton grazers can induce DA production in Pseudo-nitzschia and how bacteria interact with Pseudo-nitzschia. Since 2012, new discoveries have been reported on physiological controls of Pseudo-nitzschia growth and DA production, its sexual reproduction, and infection by an oomycete parasitoid. Many advances are the result of applying molecular approaches to discovering new species, and to understanding the population genetic structure of Pseudo-nitzschia and mechanisms used to cope with iron limitation. The availability of genomes from three Pseudo-nitzschia species, coupled with a comparative transcriptomic approach, has allowed advances in our understanding of the sexual reproduction of Pseudo-nitzschia, its signaling pathways, its interactions with bacteria, and genes involved in iron and vitamin B12 and B7 metabolism. Although there have been no new confirmed cases of ASP since 1987 because of monitoring efforts, new blooms have occurred. A massive toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom affected the entire west coast of North America during 2015-2016, and was linked to a 'warm blob' of ocean water. Other smaller toxic blooms occurred in the Gulf of Mexico and east coast of North America.

However, inherent characteristics of abattoir condemnation data can bias results from space-time cluster detection methods for disease surveillance, and may need to be accounted for using various adjustment methods. The objective of this study was to compare the space-time scan statistics with different abilities to control for covariates and to assess their suitability for food animal syndromic surveillance. Four space-time scan statistic models were used including: animal class adjusted Poisson, space-time permutation, multi-level model adjusted Poisson, and a weighted normal scan statistic using model residuals. The scan statistics were applied to monthly bovine pneumonic lung and ""parasitic liver"" condemnation data from Ontario provincial abattoirs from 2001-2007. Results: The number and space-time characteristics of identified clusters often varied between space-time scan tests for both ""parasitic liver"" and pneumonic lung condemnation data. While there were some similarities between isolated clusters in space, time and/or space-time, overall the results from space-time scan statistics differed substantially depending on the covariate adjustment approach used. Conclusions: Variability in results among methods suggests that caution should be used in selecting space-time scan methods for abattoir surveillance.

All the villages from where A. fluviatilis were collected were located adjacent to a canal which carries discharged water from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) plant along with surplus water from the tributary of the Upper Ganga Canal. The density of A. fluviatilis in this area was regularly monitored in six representative villages located adjacent to the NTPC canal, where A. fluviatilis was detected for the first time. Indoor resting adult mosquitoes were collected at monthly intervals up to September 2012. Anopheline larvae were also collected periodically and reared in the laboratory up to the adult stage for identification morphologically and by molecular method for reconfirmation of species. The collection of mosquitoes in the 6 study villages revealed the prevalence of A. fluviatilis throughout the study period, except during the winter months of January and February. The peak mosquito density of A. fluviatilis was recorded from July to September in each year. The appearance and disappearance of A. fluviatilis was correlated with the presence and absence of thick water hyacinth vegetation cover in the NTPC canal. A total of 503 A. culicifacies s.l. and 747 A. fluviatilis were collected during the year 2010. All the A. fluviatilis specimens (n=66) examined were identified as species T of the A. fluviatilis complex and were monomorphic for q1 inversion. Representative samples (n=10) that were sequenced for D3 domain of 28S rDNA were found to be 100% homologous to A. fluviatilis species T.

Media representations of unfolding events, scientific uncertainty, and real and perceived risks shape public acceptance of health policy and therefore policy outcomes. To characterize and track views in popular circulation on the causes, consequences and appropriate policy responses to the emergence of Hendra virus as a zoonotic risk, this study examines coverage of this issue in Australian mass media for the period 2007-2011. Results demonstrate the predominant explanation for the emergence of Hendra became the encroachment of flying fox populations on human settlement. Depictions of scientific uncertainty as to whom and what was at risk from Hendra virus promoted the view that flying foxes were a direct risk to human health. Descriptions of the best strategy to address Hendra have become polarized between recognized health authorities advocating individualized behaviour changes to limit risk exposure; versus populist calls for flying fox control and eradication. Less than a quarter of news reports describe the ecological determinants of emerging infectious disease or upstream policy solutions. Because flying foxes rather than horses were increasingly represented as the proximal source of human infection, existing policies of flying fox protection became equated with government inaction; the plight of those affected by flying foxes representative of a moral failure. These findings illustrate the potential for health communications for emerging infectious disease risks to become entangled in other political agendas, with implications for the public's likelihood of supporting public policy and risk management strategies that require behavioural change or seek to address the ecological drivers of incidence.",major,behavioural changes,minor,behavioural changes,major,emerging infectious diseases,minor,emerging infectious diseases,major,health policy,minor,health policy,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,mass media,minor,mass media,major,risk,minor,risk,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,zoonoses,minor,zoonoses,major,Australia,minor,Australia,geo,Australia,major,Hendra virus,minor,Hendra virus,major,man,minor,man,major,Pteropus,minor,Pteropus,minor,behavior change,minor,emerging diseases,minor,emerging infections,minor,news media,minor,viral infections,minor,zoonotic infections,minor,APEC countries,minor,Australasia,minor,Oceania,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,Developed Countries,minor,OECD Countries,minor,Henipavirus,minor,Paramyxovirinae,minor,Paramyxoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA Viruses,minor,ssRNA Viruses,minor,RNA Viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Pteropodidae,minor,Chiroptera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Degeling, C.","Kerridge, I.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Hendra in the news: public policy meets public morality in times of zoonotic uncertainty.,,,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20133165864&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20133165864,320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,156-163,163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iron sulfate was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'), and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011. In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. The peer review was initiated on 25 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier the European Iron Sulphate Task Force (EISTF) and on 24 February 2011 to the Member States for consultation and comments. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on iron sulfate. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of iron sulfate as a herbicide on amenity and sports turf for the control of moss, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Data gaps were identified for the section identity, physical and chemical properties and analytical methods. With regard to the mammalian toxicology section, two critical areas of concern were identified: the compliance of the batches tested with the proposed specification could not be demonstrated, and the operator exposure exceeded the AOEL with the hand-held equipment (belly grinder), even with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The representative use of the active substance iron sulfate is restricted to amenity turf and sports turf for the control of moss. Consequently, no residues are to be expected in food of plant or animal origin and a consumer risk assessment is therefore not necessary. A data gap was identified for satisfactory information on the natural buffering capacity of surface water bodies in Europe to neutralize acid inputs from sulfate ions potentially formed following the representative use of iron sulfate, and on the possible adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Based on the available information, supported by worst-case assumptions, there are indications that predicted environmental concentrations in groundwater of iron ions will exceed the EU drinking water indicator parameter. Finally, it cannot be concluded if the use of iron sulfate will have an impact on the natural levels of the relevant inorganic impurities (heavy metals and arsenic) in soils and surface waters in Europe. The risk to birds and mammals, honeybees and other non-target arthropods, non-target soil organisms, terrestrial non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use. Considering the available data, a potential high risk to aquatic organisms could not be excluded.

In this work we studied the production in Escherichia coli of a recombinant transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis (microbial transglutaminase or MTGase) as enzymatically active chimeric forms using different expression systems under the control of both lac promoter or thermoinducible phage lambda promoter. Results: Thermoinducible and constitutive expression vectors were constructed expressing Met-MTGase with chimeric LacZ1-8 PNP1-20 or LacZ1-8 fusion protein under different promoters. After transformed in competent Escherichia coli K12 strains were fermented in batch and fed-bach mode in different mediums in order to select the best conditions of expression. The two most performing fusion protein systems namely short thermoinducible LacZ1-8 Met-MTGase from NP668/1 and long constitutive LacZ1-8 PNP1-20 Met-MTGase from NP650/1 has been chosen to compare both efficiency of expression and biochemical qualities of the product. Proteins were extracted, purified to homogeneity and verified as a single peak obtained in RP-HPLC.

In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 1 December 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 2 December 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 19 January 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on fenbutatin oxide. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of fenbutatin oxide as an acaricide on apples, orange and tomato, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. For physical chemical properties no critical areas of concern were identified. Data gaps were identified for the relevant impurity and methods of analysis for all matrices except products of animal origin. A clear conclusion on whether the toxicological batches cover the proposed specification cannot be drawn as sufficient data are not available. Consequently a data gap and a critical area of concern have been identified. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level, for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination by fenbutatin oxide was assessed as low from these representative uses. A data gap was identified to provide information on the ecotoxicological relevance of the impurity SD 31723. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to mammals and to insectivorous birds, also taking into account all relevant species/feeding guilds, for the representative field uses evaluated. A high risk to earthworm-eating mammals and to fish-eating birds and mammals was not excluded and a data gap was identified. A high risk was identified to aquatic organisms at FOCUS step 4 providing mitigation measures comparable to no-spray buffer zone of up to 30 m. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to aquatic invertebrates, taking into account the GAP and the most sensitive group. Further, a data gap was identified to refine the risk to fish, taking into account the behaviour of the substance in aquatic systems. A potential high first tier risk was indicated for non-target arthropods and earthworms, but was further addressed by the submitted higher tier studies.

The state of Mato Grosso do Sul is located between the tropical endemic region and the subtropical epidemic region and, despite being an area recommended for vaccination since the 1980s, human and animal cases of the disease are still registered. The purpose of this study was to present the results of entomological surveys of probable sites of infection (PSI) geographically describing these areas regarding human cases and disease suspicion reported in 2008. Thirteen locations in nine municipalities were investigated. A total of 305 females of the genus Haemagogus and Sabethes and five specimens of Aedes albopictus were obtained. The genus Haemagogus was more abundant but Sabethes presented twice as many species (3×6) and higher distribution within the collection points. The most abundant species was Hg. janthinomys, with 102 individuals in one location. The other species found were: Hg. leucocelaenus, Hg. spegazzinii, Sa. albiprivus, Sa. belisarioi, Sa. chloropterus, Sa. glaucodaemun, Sa. intermedius and Sa. soperi. It was not possible to identify predominant species in relation to environmental and geographical characteristics of the collection points. Of the nine human cases, eight corresponded to persons not resident in the State, seven of them tourists. MS features a large diversity of rural and wildlife tourist attractions where the yellow fever vectors described in this work are present.

,,"""print""",3070565,International Journal of Obesity,2015,,,2015,39,3,London,Journal Article,"Objectives: The corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF)/urocortin system is expressed in the adipose tissue of mammals, but its functional role in this tissue remains unknown. Methods: Pharmacological manipulation of the activity of CRF receptors, CRF1 and CRF2, was performed in 3T3 L1 white pre-adipocytes and T37i brown pre-adipocytes during in vitro differentiation. The expression of genes of the CRF/urocortin system and of markers of white and brown adipocytes was evaluated along with mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular oxygen consumption. Metabolic evaluation of corticosterone-deficient or supplemented Crhr1-null (Crhr1-/-) mice and their wild-type controls was performed along with gene expression analysis carried out in white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues. Results: Peptides of the CRF/urocortin system and their cognate receptors were expressed in both pre-adipocyte cell lines. In vitro pharmacological studies showed an inhibition of the expression of the CRF2 pathway by the constitutive activity of the CRF1 pathway. Pharmacological activation of CRF2 and, to a lesser extent, inhibition of CRF1 signaling induced molecular and functional changes indicating transdifferentiation of white pre-adipocytes and differentiation of brown pre-adipocytes. Crhr1-/- mice showed increased expression of CRF2 and its agonist Urocortin 2 in adipocytes that was associated to brown conversion of WAT and activation of BAT. Crhr1-/- mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Restoring physiological circulating corticosterone levels abrogated molecular changes in adipocytes and the favorable phenotype of Crhr1-/- mice. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the importance of the CRF2 pathway in the control of adipocyte plasticity. Increased CRF2 activity in adipocytes induces browning of WAT, differentiation of BAT and is associated with a favorable metabolic phenotype in mice lacking CRF1. Circulating corticosterone represses CRF2 activity in adipocytes and may thus regulate adipocyte physiology through the modulation of the local CRF/urocortin system. Targeting CRF receptor signaling specifically in the adipose tissue may represent a novel approach to tackle obesity.",major,adipocytes,minor,adipocytes,major,adipose tissue,minor,adipose tissue,major,agonists,minor,agonists,major,animal models,minor,animal models,major,cell lines,minor,cell lines,major,control,minor,control,major,corticosterone,minor,corticosterone,major,diets,minor,diets,major,differentiation,minor,differentiation,major,evaluation,minor,evaluation,major,gene expression,minor,gene expression,major,genes,minor,genes,major,in vitro,minor,in vitro,major,inhibition,minor,inhibition,major,mitochondria,minor,mitochondria,major,models,minor,models,major,obesity,minor,obesity,major,oxygen consumption,minor,oxygen consumption,major,peptides,minor,peptides,major,phenotypes,minor,phenotypes,major,physiology,minor,physiology,major,production,minor,production,major,receptors,minor,receptors,major,research,minor,research,major,mammals,minor,mammals,major,man,minor,man,major,mice,minor,mice,minor,biogenesis,minor,fat cells,minor,fatness,minor,studies,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Muridae,minor,rodents,minor,mammals,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,"Lu, B.","Diz-Chaves, Y.","Markovic, D.","Contarino, A.","Penicaud, L.","Fanelli, F.","Clark, S.","Lehnert, H.","Cota, D.","Grammatopoulos, D.

The nanomaterial has been demonstrated as a molecular transducer for electrochemical DNA detection. The nanocomposite MWCNTs-PPy has been formed by wrapping the PPy film on MWCNTs during electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole on the gold electrode. The MWCNTs-PPy layer was modified with PAMAM dendrimers of fourth generation (PAMAM G4) with covalent bonding by electro-oxidation method. Ferrocenyl groups were then attached to the surface as a redox marker. The electrochemical properties of the nanomaterial (MWCNTs-PPy-PAMAM-Fc) were studied using both square wave voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry to demonstrate efficient electron transfer. The nanomaterial shows high performance in the electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization leading to a variation in the electrochemical signal of ferrocene with a detection limit of 0.3 fM. Furthermore, the biosensor demonstrates ability for sensing DNA of rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in real PCR samples. Developed biosensor was suitable for detection of sequences with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T (TCG/TTG), responsible for resistance of M. tuberculosis to rifampicin drug, and discriminating them from wild-type samples without such mutation.

The morphology and surface of the obtained particles were characterized using SEM. These images show that all samples have a particle size below 30 nm. The obtained immobilized preparation has specific activity of 0.134 U/g support when measured at 40°C using maltose as substrate. Immobilization process was almost fully completed after 30 min of the reaction at 30°C. The highest immobilization yield of the enzyme was achieved at glutaraldehyde concentration of 10 mM. No significant differences in optimal pH and temperature were observed upon immobilization. The immobilized trehalose synthase exhibited mass transfer limitation, which is reflected by higher KM and activation energy values.

The case fatality rate remains the highest among infectious diseases, and medical treatments have proven ineffective. Objective. - This study analyzes the rabies epidemic of 1929 to 1937 in Trinidad from a geographical perspective, using Geographic Information System (GIS) software as an analytical tool. Setting. - A small island developing country at a time when infectious diseases were rampant. Methods. - A review of the literature was undertaken, and data were collected on the occurrence of disease in both animal and humans populations and mapped using GIS software. Several factors identified in the literature were further explored such as land use/land cover, rainfall and magnetic declination. Results. - The bat rabies epidemic of 1923 to 1937 in Trinidad was migratory and seasonal, shifting to new locations along a definite path. The pattern of spread appears to be spatially linked to land use/land cover. The epidemic continues to present many unexplained peculiarities. Conclusion. - Despite the fact that this epidemic occurred almost 7 decades ago, the application of new tools available for public health use can create new knowledge and understanding of events. We showed that the spatial of distribution of the disease followed a distinct pathway possible due to the use of electromagnetic capabilities of bats.",major,disease distribution,minor,disease distribution,major,disease incidence,minor,disease incidence,major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,epidemics,minor,epidemics,major,epidemiology,minor,epidemiology,major,geographical distribution,minor,geographical distribution,major,geographical information systems,minor,geographical information systems,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,literature reviews,minor,literature reviews,major,methodology,minor,methodology,major,rabies,minor,rabies,major,techniques,minor,techniques,major,viral diseases,minor,viral diseases,major,Trinidad,minor,Trinidad,geo,Trinidad,major,man,minor,man,major,Rabies virus,minor,Rabies virus,minor,geographic information systems,minor,GIS,minor,methods,minor,viral infections,minor,Homo,minor,Hominidae,minor,Primates,minor,mammals,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Lyssavirus,minor,Rhabdoviridae,minor,Mononegavirales,minor,negative-sense ssRNA viruses,minor,ssRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,minor,viruses,minor,Trinidad and Tobago,minor,ACP Countries,minor,Caribbean Community,minor,Commonwealth of Nations,minor,Developing Countries,minor,Lesser Antilles,minor,Antilles,minor,Caribbean,minor,America,minor,Threshold Countries,,,,,,,,,,,"Mungrue, K.","Mahabir, R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,The rabies epidemic in Trinidad of 1923 to 1937: an evaluation with a geographic information system.,doi,10.1016/j.wem.2010.11.001,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20113152073&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20113152073,337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28-36,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This wildlife includes migratory birds arriving from WNV endemic areas in Africa and Central Europe. Here we have conducted a combined mosquito and virological survey as a first step to assess the risks for public and veterinary health of this nature reserve as ecosystem for enzootic WNV circulation. Thirteen different mosquito species, covering five different genera were collected. Remarkable is the presence of Anopheles algeriensis, a mediterranean species. Eleven of the 13 species are reported field or laboratory vectors for a variety of infectious pathogens, including WNV, Usutu virus, Tahyna virus, Sindbis virus, Batai virus, Lednice virus, Francisella tularensis and Dirofilaria immitis. Although seven potential WNV vector species were collected, viz.

Deletion of genes encoding ATGL (Pnpla2) or HSL (Lipe) in mice results in striking phenotypic differences, suggesting distinct roles for these lipases. The goal of the present study was to identify the biological processes that are modulated in the metabolic tissues of ATGL- and HSL-deficient mice. DNA microarrays were employed to provide full genome coverage concerning the types of genes that are differentially expressed in wild-type and mutant mice. For both mouse models, transcript signatures were identified in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue (BAT), skeletal muscle (SM), cardiac muscle (CM), and liver. Genetic ablation of ATGL and HSL alters the transcript levels of a large number of genes in metabolic tissues. The genes affected in the two models are, however, largely different ones. Indeed, only one biological process was modulated in the same way in both mouse models, namely the down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism in BAT. The most pronounced modulation of biological processes was observed in ATGL-/- CM, in which a concerted down-regulation of transcripts associated with oxidative pathways was observed. In HSL-/- mice, in contrast, the most marked changes were seen in SM, namely, alterations in transcript levels reflecting a change of energy source from lipid to carbohydrate. The transcript signatures also provided novel insights into the metabolic derangements that are characteristic of ATGL-/- mice. Our findings suggest that ATGL and HSL differentially modulate biological processes in metabolic tissues.

,,"""print""",14752875,Malaria Journal,2010,,,2010,9,106,London,Journal Article,"Background: Anopheles culicifacies is the major vector of both falciparum and vivax malaria in Sri Lanka, while Anopheles subpictus and certain other species function as secondary vectors. In Sri Lanka, An. culicifacies is present as a species complex consisting of species B and E, while An. subpictus exists as a complex of species A-D. The freshwater breeding habit of An. culicifacies is well established. In order to further characterize the breeding sites of the major malaria vectors in Sri Lanka, a limited larval survey was carried out at a site in the Eastern province that was affected by the 2004 Asian tsunami. Methods: Anopheline larvae were collected fortnightly for six months from a brackish water body near Batticaloa town using dippers. Collected larvae were reared in the laboratory and the emerged adults were identified using standard keys. Sibling species status was established based on Y-chromosome morphology for An. culicifacies larvae and morphometric characteristics for An. subpictus larvae and adults. Salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were determined at the larval collection site. Results: During a six month study covering dry and wet seasons, a total of 935 anopheline larvae were collected from this site that had salinity levels up to 4 parts per thousand at different times. Among the emerged adult mosquitoes, 661 were identified as An. culicifacies s.l. and 58 as An. subpictus s.l. Metaphase karyotyping of male larvae showed the presence of species E of the Culicifacies complex, and adult morphometric analysis the presence of species B of the Subpictus complex. Both species were able to breed in water with salinity levels up to 4 ppt. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the ability of An. culicifacies species E, the major vector of falciparum and vivax malaria in Sri Lanka, to oviposit and breed in brackish water. The sibling species B in the An. subpictus complex, a well-known salt water breeder and a secondary malaria vector in the country, was also detected at the same site.

Collections of these species are discussed in relation to distribution and hosts. Seven ticks collections (four from Brazil, one from Argentina, one from Uruguay and one from USA) house a total of 1272 A. aureolatum (224 males, 251 females, 223 nymphs and 574 larvae) and 1164 A. ovale (535 males, 556 females, 66 nymphs and 7 larvae). The length of the sequenced mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fragment for A. aureolatum was 370 bp and for A. ovale was 373 bp. The DNA sequence analysis showed a 13.1% difference between the two species. Apart from one male A. ovale found on a toad, all adult ticks were found on mammals. The majority of adult specimens of both tick species were removed from Carnivora (96.1 and 84.3% of A. aureolatum and A. ovale, respectively), especially from dogs (53.1% of A. aureolatum, and 46.4% of A. ovale). Collections on wild Canidae were higher for A. aureolatum (23.3%) than for A. ovale (7.1%). On the other hand, collections of A. ovale adults on wild Felidae were higher (18.3%) than findings of A. aureolatum (9.2%). The contribution of other mammalian orders as hosts for adults of A. aureolatum and A. ovale was irrelevant, with the exception of Perissodactyla because Tapiridae contributed with 13.0% of the total number of A. ovale adults. Adults of both tick species have been found occasionally on domestic hosts (apart of the dog) and humans. Most immature stages of A. aureolatum were found on Passeriformes birds, while rodents and carnivores were the most common hosts for nymphs and larvae of A. ovale. A. aureolatum has been found restricted to the Neotropical region, covering the eastern area of South America from Uruguay to Surinam, including northeastern Argentina, eastern Paraguay, southeastern Brazil and French Guiana. A. ovale showed a distribution that covers the Neotropical region from central-northern Argentina throughout the Neotropics into the Nearctic region of Mexico with a few records from the USA, also with collection sites in Paraguay, Bolivia, most Brazilian states, Peru, Ecuador, French Guiana, Surinam, Guyana, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize, Guatemala and several states of Mexico.",major,disease prevalence,minor,disease prevalence,major,genes,minor,genes,major,genetic variation,minor,genetic variation,major,geographical distribution,minor,geographical distribution,major,host range,minor,host range,major,hosts,minor,hosts,major,nucleotide sequences,minor,nucleotide sequences,major,nymphs,minor,nymphs,major,Argentina,minor,Argentina,geo,Argentina,major,Brazil,minor,Brazil,geo,Brazil,major,Uruguay,minor,Uruguay,geo,Uruguay,major,USA,minor,USA,geo,USA,major,Amblyomma,minor,Amblyomma,major,Amblyomma aureolatum,minor,Amblyomma aureolatum,major,Amblyomma ovale,minor,Amblyomma ovale,major,birds,minor,birds,major,mammals,minor,mammals,minor,DNA sequences,minor,genetic variability,minor,genotypic variability,minor,genotypic variation,minor,United States of America,minor,Ixodidae,minor,Metastigmata,minor,Acari,minor,Arachnida,minor,arthropods,minor,invertebrates,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Amblyomma,minor,vertebrates,minor,Chordata,minor,Developing Countries,minor,Latin America,minor,America,minor,South America,minor,Threshold Countries,minor,APEC countries,minor,Developed Countries,minor,North America,minor,OECD Countries,,,,,,,,,"Guglielmone, A.

,,"""print""",8756971X,Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association,1992,,,1992,8,2,,Journal Article,"Two studies in California wetlands and a 3rd in Minnesota wetlands indicated that management practices designed to enhance habitat quality for waterfowl can concurrently reduce mosquito problems. In a seasonally flooded pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) wetland in Suisun Marsh, Solano County, California, it was demonstrated that reducing plant-cover by 50% increased benthic densities of chironomid midge (Chironomus stigmaterus) and dytiscid beetle (Agabus disintegratus) larvae; these insects can be important in waterfowl diets. This manipulation also concentrated Aedes melanimon and Culiseta inornata mosquito larvae along wetland perimeters; thus, the need for control measures was greatly restricted spatially. A study in 9 experimental ponds in Suisun Marsh demonstrated that higher water levels could enhance populations of the macroinvertebrates (Trichocorixa verticalis, Cricotopus sylvestris, Agabus disintegratus) important in waterfowl diets; general macroinvertebrate densities were higher at 60 cm depths than 20 cm or 40 cm depths. In contrast, Culiseta inornata densities were lowest at 60 cm depths and highest at 20 cm depths. A study conducted in a perennial-water cattail (Typha) wetland in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, demonstrated that a temporary water-level drawdown, designed to enhance waterfowl habitat quality of perennial-water wetlands, also reduced densities of Coquillettidia perturbans mosquito larvae. These mosquitoes disappeared immediately after the drawdown, but even after water depths were restored to pre-drawdown levels, significant numbers did not reappear until 4 years post-drawdown. Studies in 202 other Minnesota wetlands also demonstrated the susceptibility of C. perturbans populations to drawdown, but the impact of drawdown was greater in stands of emergent cattail than in floating cattail.",major,aquatic animals,minor,aquatic animals,major,Aquatic insects,minor,Aquatic insects,major,aquatic plants,minor,aquatic plants,major,Aquatic weeds,minor,Aquatic weeds,major,control,minor,control,major,ecology,minor,ecology,major,environmental management,minor,environmental management,major,insect control,minor,insect control,major,Marshes,minor,Marshes,major,Waterfowl,minor,Waterfowl,major,weeds,minor,weeds,major,wetlands,minor,wetlands,major,wild animals,minor,wild animals,major,Wild birds,minor,Wild birds,major,California,minor,California,geo,California,major,Minnesota,minor,Minnesota,geo,Minnesota,major,North America,minor,North America,geo,North America,major,USA,minor,USA,geo,USA,major,Aedes,minor,Aedes,major,Aedes melanimon,minor,Aedes melanimon,major,Anatidae,minor,Anatidae,major,Birds,minor,Birds,major,Chironomidae,minor,Chironomidae,major,Coleoptera,minor,Coleoptera,major,Coquillettidia perturbans,minor,Coquillettidia perturbans,major,Corixidae,minor,Corixidae,major,Cricotopus sylvestris,minor,Cricotopus sylvestris,major,Culicidae,minor,Culicidae,major,Culiseta inornata,minor,Culiseta inornata,major,Diptera,minor,Diptera,major,Dytiscidae,minor,Dytiscidae,major,Hemiptera,"Batzer, D.

,,"""print""",5074088,Voprosy Virusologii,1984,,,1984,29,1,,Journal Article,"An examination of 21 patients from south Tajikistan, USSR, showed that they were infected with Issyk-Kul' virus. The cases occurred between March and August 1982, mostly in June, July and August. The infection is probably contracted by inhaling or ingesting infective material or by being bitten by an infected mosquito. The commonest species there are Aedes caspius caspius, Culex pipiens pipiens and Anopheles hyrcanus, and the months in which their attacks are heaviest cover the period of highest incidence of the disease. Females of these species readily attack both man and bats, which are a natural reservoir of the virus. A list is given of the wild reservoir species of the disease, and it includes 5 species of bats and 7 species of birds. The arthropods that become infected through feeding on these are the ticks Argas vespertilionis, A. pusillus and Ixodes vespertilionis and the mosquitoes Aedes caspius and Anopheles hyrcanus. Antibodies to the virus have been found in birds in Kirgizia and Tajikistan, and birds, as well as man, are commonly attacked by C. p. pipiens. Antibodies have also been found in domestic mice (3.8% of cases) and red-tailed gerbil (Meriones erythrourus) (1.9%). In Kirgizia, antibodies were generally absent in the inhabitants of villages, but were found in 1.5% of persons examined in the Chui valley. In Tajikistan, antibodies were found on average in 2.7% of tests, but in the south-west of the republic they occurred in 5.7-7.8%. The distribution of the virus in these republics is shown in a map.&lt;new para&gt;ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:&lt;new para&gt;Twenty one human cases are discussed. Seroconversion was demonstrated in 17 patients. The virus was isolated from the blood in 2-day-old mice. The main symptoms of the disease were fever (39-41 °C) in all patients which lasted 8 days, headache (in 80%), respiratory symptoms (30%) and muscle pain (30%). There were no deaths. The main reservoirs of the virus are bats and bat ticks. The virus has also been isolated from birds and mosquitoes.K.

Emphasis is on the study of the disease in animals other than man. An introductory chapter on the nature of rabies is followed by three on the virus, covering its structure, culture in vitro and interactions with host cells. There are then three chapters on the disease, covering pathogenesis, genetic control of resistance and immune responses (to vaccines and natural infections). Rabies-related viruses (Lagos bat, Mokola, Duvenhage, Obodhiang and Kotonkan) are described in chapter 8, and this is followed by two chapters on diagnosis. Epidemiology in Eurasia and Africa, and the Americas, and persistence of rabies in wildlife are discussed in chapters 11-13, and the final five chapters cover control. Aspects covered are: vaccines and vaccination of domestic animals, recombinant virus vaccine, control of wildlife rabies in Europe and the Americas, and control of urban rabies.

Eggs were placed in several different surface and subterranean larval habitats; and after four dry season months, only 1-10% of eggs remained viable in the surface and subterranean sites, respectively. Low humidity and predation by Periplaneta americana were the major causes of egg mortality in eggs in surface sites. P. americana was the most significant cause of egg predation in subterranean breeding sites but fungi, especially Penicillium citrinum, covered egg batches within 15 days. Mycotoxins produced by the spores of P. citrinum are believed to have killed embryonating eggs.

At one suburb, Ae. notoscriptus immatures were found in 61.1% and 47.3% of premises, during winter and summer, respectively. Natural habitats, mainly bromeliad axils, garden accoutrements and discarded items accounted for 86% and 81% of infested containers in summer and winter, respectively. However, when larval productivity was accounted for, discarded household items and garden accoutrements were the most important container types. The Premise Condition Index (house condition, garden condition, shade cover) did not positively relate to the presence of Ae. notoscriptus larvae, nor to numbers of infested containers per premise. Similarly, the presence of inbuilt garden sprinkler systems could not be used as an indicator to predict premises that would be positive for Ae. notoscriptus immatures. The number of adult Ae. notoscriptus (21.3% of total) collected using light traps was second to the number of Culex annulirostris (Skuse) (48.9%) collected. These traps were unsuitable for monitoring Ae. notoscriptus during autumn and winter when Ae. notoscriptis activity shifted to the afternoon, and when traps were not operating. In terms of targeted approaches to control Ae. notoscriptus immatures, rubbish collection campaigns undertaken before the wet season should be focused on the removal of discarded household items, rubbish and tyres. Specific health education messages should be used to inform householders of the need to regularly clean or remove pot plant bases and bird baths.

Research Methods and Procedures: Transient expression of wild-type and K107R-PPARγ2 in the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line was carried out in conjunction with half-life studies, luciferase activity assays, and indirect immunofluorescence localization studies. Additional in vitro analysis was carried out using recombinant SUMOylation pathway proteins along with in vitro transcribed and translated wild-type or K107R-PPARγ2 to examine the SUMO-1 modification state of wild-type and SUMO-deficient K107R-PPARγ2. Results: While examining PPARγ2 for potential ubiquitylation sites, we identified a strong consensus site for SUMO modification that contains lysine 107. In vitro, SUMOylation studies showed that lysine 107 of PPARγ2 is a major SUMOylation site and that at least one other SUMOylation site is present in PPARγ. In addition, our results demonstrated that SUMO-1 affects PPARγ stability and transcriptional activity but not the nuclear localization of PPARγ. Discussion: These results indicated that SUMOylation plays a role in regulating PPARγ, both indirectly and directly by modification of lysine 107. Because PPARγ is regulated in numerous animal models of obesity, understanding the covalent modifications of PPARγ may enhance our understanding of the metabolic syndrome.",major,biochemical receptors,minor,biochemical receptors,major,cell lines,minor,cell lines,major,in vitro,minor,in vitro,major,lysine,minor,lysine,major,metabolism,minor,metabolism,major,peroxisomes,minor,peroxisomes,major,transactivation,minor,transactivation,minor,transcriptional activation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Floyd, Z.

In January 2007, the UK government introduced a programme to vaccinate poultry workers to reduce the potential of such an event. This study evaluates the delivery, uptake and costs of the programme in three counties of England. A questionnaire survey was completed by consultants in public health in all the Primary Care Trusts in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire in May 2007. The delivery of the programme varied between Primary Care Trusts, including being delivered in some cases by clinics in primary care, by general practitioners and occupational health services in others.

,,"""print""",9320113,Parasitology Research,2009,,,2009,105,2,Heidelberg,Journal Article,"In the summer of 2006, a bluetongue epidemic started in the border area of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany, spread within 2 years over large areas of Western and Central Europe, and caused substantial losses in farm ruminants. Especially sheep and cattle were severely affected, leading to a case-fatality ratio of nearly 40% in sheep. The German federal ministry of food, agriculture, and consumer protection (BMELV) established a countrywide monitoring on the occurrence of the vectors of this virus, i.e., midges (family Ceratopogonidae) of the genus Culicoides. The monitoring was done on 91 sites, most of which were localized in the 150-km restriction zone that existed in December 2006. A grid consisting of 45×45 km2 cells was formed that covered the monitoring area. As a rule, one trap was placed into each grid cell. The monitoring program started at the end of March 2007 and lasted until May 2008. It included the catching of midges by ultraviolet light traps-done each month from days 1 until 8, the selection of midges of the Culicoides obsoletus, Culicoides pulicaris group, and other Culicoides spp., the testing of midges for bluetongue virus (BTV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the daily registration of weather data at each trap site for the whole monitoring period. The following main results were obtained: (1) Members of the C. obsoletus group were most commonly found in the traps, reaching often 3/4 of the catches. The African and South European vector of BTV - the species Culicoides imicola - was never found. (2) Members of the C. obsoletus group were most frequently found infected with BTV besides a few cases in the C. pulicaris group and other species. (3) Members of the C. obsoletus group were also found in winter. Their numbers were reduced, however, and they were caught mostly close to stables. Therefore, a true midge-free period does not exist during the year in Germany. (4) The amounts of midges caught daily depended on the weather conditions. If it was cold and/or windy, the traps contained only a few specimens. Since the months from January to May 2008 were considerably colder (at all farms) than their correspondents in 2007, the growing of the population of midges started 2-3 months later in 2008 than in 2007. (5) The highest populations of midges occurred in both years (2007 and 2008) during the months September and October. This corresponded significantly to the finding of highest numbers of infected midges and to the number of diseased cattle and sheep during these 2 months. (6) It is noteworthy that in general, the first virus-positive midges of the species C. obsoletus were found about 1 1/2 months later than the first clinical cases had occurred or later than the first PCR-proven virus-positive sentinel animals had been documented. In 2007, the first BTV-positive cattle were detected in May in North Rhine-Westphalia, while the first positive Culicoides specimens were only found in August on the same farm. Evaluating these main results of the entomological monitoring and the fact that many wild ruminants have also been infected with BTV, it becomes evident that bluetongue disease has become endemic in Central Europe, and that only constant effort including vaccination and perhaps also insecticidal protection of cattle and sheep will keep the economical losses at a reasonable level.",major,consumer protection,minor,consumer protection,major,epidemics,minor,epidemics,major,monitoring,minor,monitoring,major,parasites,minor,parasites,major,parasitology,minor,parasitology,major,parasitoses,minor,parasitoses,major,sentinel animals,minor,sentinel animals,major,stables,minor,stables,major,traps,minor,traps,major,ultraviolet radiation,minor,ultraviolet radiation,major,vaccination,minor,vaccination,major,vectors,minor,vectors,major,weather,minor,weather,major,winter,minor,winter,major,world,minor,world,major,Belgium,minor,Belgium,geo,Belgium,major,Central Europe,minor,Central Europe,geo,Central Europe,major,Europe,minor,Europe,geo,Europe,major,Germany,minor,Germany,geo,Germany,major,Netherlands,minor,Netherlands,geo,Netherlands,major,North Rhine-Westphalia,minor,North Rhine-Westphalia,geo,North Rhine-Westphalia,major,animals,minor,animals,major,bluetongue virus,minor,bluetongue virus,major,cattle,minor,cattle,major,Ceratopogonidae,minor,Ceratopogonidae,major,Culicoides,minor,Culicoides,major,Culicoides imicola,minor,Culicoides imicola,major,Culicoides obsoletus,minor,Culicoides obsoletus,major,Culicoides pulicaris,minor,Culicoides pulicaris,major,man,minor,man,major,ruminants,"Mehlhorn, H.","Walldorf, V.","Klimpel, S.","Schaub, G.","Kiel, E.","Focke, R.","Liebisch, G.","Liebisch, A.","Werner, D.","Bauer, C.","Clausen, H.","Bauer, B.","Geier, M.","Hörbrand, T.",Bluetongue disease in Germany (2007-2008): monitoring of entomological aspects.,doi,10.1007/s00436-009-1416-y,eng,English,https://proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lhh&AN=20093196240&site=ehost-live&scope=site,lhh,Global Health,20093196240,357,,minor,ruminants,major,sheep,minor,sheep,major,viruses,minor,viruses,minor,consumer advocacy,minor,Nordrhein-Westfalen,minor,parasitic diseases,minor,parasitic infestations,minor,parasitosis,minor,surveillance systems,minor,worldwide,313-319,319,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Orbivirus,minor,Reoviridae,minor,dsRNA viruses,minor,RNA viruses,"Bätza, H.

The two forms of PrP appear to have identical covalent structures, but differ in secondary and tertiary structure. Both PrPC and PrPSc have glycosylphospatidylinositol (GPI) anchors through which the protein is tethered to cell membranes. Membrane attachment has been suggested to play a role in the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, but the majority of in vitro studies of the function, structure, folding and stability of PrP use recombinant protein lacking the GPI anchor. In order to study the effects of membranes on the structure of PrP, we synthesized a GPI anchor mimetic (GPIm), which we have covalently coupled to a genetically engineered cysteine residue at the C-terminus of recombinant PrP. The lipid anchor places the protein at the same distance from the membrane as does the naturally occurring GPI anchor. We demonstrate that PrP coupled to GPIm (PrP-GPIm) inserts into model lipid membranes and that structural information can be obtained from this membrane-anchored PrP. We show that the structure of PrP-GPIm reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine and raft membranes resembles that of PrP, without a GPI anchor, in solution. The results provide experimental evidence in support of previous suggestions that NMR structures of soluble, anchor-free forms of PrP represent the structure of cellular, membrane-anchored PrP.

Its covalent structure was determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry; it contains four disulfide-bridges, of which one of the pairs is formed between cysteine-7 and cysteine-8 (positions Cys63-Cys71). The other three pairs are formed between Cys13-Cys38, Cys23-Cys50 and Cys27-Cys52. Comparative sequence analysis shows that phaiodotoxin belongs to the long-chain subfamily of scorpion peptides. Several genes coding for this peptide and similar ones were cloned by PCR, using cDNA prepared from the RNA of venomous glands of this scorpion. Electrophysiological assays conducted with this toxin in several mammalian cell lines (TE671, COS7, rat GH3 and cerebellum granular cells), showed no effect on Na+ currents. However, it shifts the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of insect Na+ channels (para/tipE) to more negative and positive potentials, respectively. Therefore, the 'window' current is increased by 225%, which is thought to be the cause of its toxicity toward insects.

,,"""print""",207519,International Journal for Parasitology,2002,,,2002,32,5,Oxford,Journal Article,"Chemotherapy is central to the control of many parasite infections of both medical and veterinary importance. However, control has been compromised by the emergence of drug resistance in several important parasite species. Such parasites cover a broad phylogenetic range and include protozoa, helminths and arthropods. To achieve effective parasite control in the future, the recognition and diagnosis of resistance will be crucial. This demand for early, accurate diagnosis of resistance to specific drugs in different parasite species can potentially be met by modern molecular techniques. This paper summarizes the resistance status of a range of important parasites and reviews the available molecular techniques for resistance diagnosis. Opportunities for applying successes in some species to other species where resistance is less well understood are explored. The practical application of molecular techniques and the impact of the technology on improving parasite control are discussed.",major,animal parasitic nematodes,minor,animal parasitic nematodes,major,anthelmintics,minor,anthelmintics,major,antiprotozoal agents,minor,antiprotozoal agents,major,benzimidazole,minor,benzimidazole,major,coccidiosis,minor,coccidiosis,major,coccidiostats,minor,coccidiostats,major,disease control,minor,disease control,major,drug resistance,minor,drug resistance,major,drug therapy,minor,drug therapy,major,ectoparasites,minor,ectoparasites,major,genes,minor,genes,major,giardiasis,minor,giardiasis,major,human diseases,minor,human diseases,major,lactones,minor,lactones,major,levamisole,minor,levamisole,major,malaria,minor,malaria,major,molecular genetics,minor,molecular genetics,major,polymerase chain reaction,minor,polymerase chain reaction,major,poultry,minor,poultry,major,resistance mechanisms,minor,resistance mechanisms,major,reviews,minor,reviews,major,trichomoniasis,minor,trichomoniasis,major,Eimeria,minor,Eimeria,major,fowls,minor,fowls,major,Giardia,minor,Giardia,major,Giardia duodenalis,minor,Giardia duodenalis,major,Lucilia cuprina,minor,Lucilia cuprina,major,man,minor,man,major,Plasmodium,minor,Plasmodium,major,sheep,minor,sheep,major,Trichomonas,minor,Trichomonas,major,Trichomonas vaginalis,minor,Trichomonas vaginalis,major,Trichostrongylidae,minor,Trichostrongylidae,minor,animal-parasitic nematodes,"Sangster, N.","Batterham, P.","Chapman, H.

,,,,,1984,,,1984,,709,Geneva,Annual report,"The decision to initiate post-exposure treatment still apparently poses considerable difficulty for the physician. [This remains understandable when nervous-tissue vaccines are used but when modern cell-culture vaccines of acknowledged innocuity, safety and efficacy (see pp. 14, 27, 28 and 32) are used the ""physician's dilemma"" must be considerably reduced.] The committee remains firmly convinced that the ""combined administration of antirabies serum and vaccine, together with the local treatment of the wound, provides the best possible prophylaxis of rabies in an exposed person"". Dose schedules for several types of vaccine and antisera are given as well as advice on treatment and handling of clinical rabies in man with reference to intensive care and to the safety of personnel involved.Guidelines for national programmes for controlling rabies in dogs and other domestic animals are much more elaborate than in the previous report. This section covers in considerable detail the technical aspects, the planning, management, financing and international coordination of control schemes. The section on the international transfer of animals is extended by policy recommendations and there is a plea for some international unanimity in import requirements.The section on the control of rabies in many species of wildlife is extensive and the successful oral immunization of foxes in Switzerland is noted. The involvement of vampire and other bats in the epidemiology of rabies and methods for its control are discussed.The implementation of previous recommendations on information exchange was noted with satisfaction by the committee, as were the efforts of the other international agencies.Notes on group training, seminars and fellowships are followed by 21 recommendations. These include the need for studies on the pathogenesis of rabies, the adoption of improved diagnostic methods, the continued improvement in the preparation, testing and application of vaccines and sera. There are also recommendations for continuing studies on the ecology of the host species for rabies, both domestic and wild and of the development of national control programmes.Eight annexes include guides for post-exposure treatment, suggestions for case records, vaccination certificates, useful addresses and a selected bibliography.G.S.

The rate of abortion for 274 control flies rose from 1.1% on day 1 to 6.3% on day 5 then declined to the last abortions on day 9. The increase of rate probably resulted from increasing period of starvation. Significantly increased rates of abortion of eggs or immature larvae, compared with the control, were only found with high doses of fenitrothion, propoxur, permethrin and dieldrin and with various doses of Sumithrin [phenothrin], Sumicidin [fenvalerate] and deltamethrin. Abortion was most frequent for the last 3, synthetic pyrethroids. All significant rates were for rapid abortion, within 24 h after treatment, and many abortions for phenothrin, fenvalerate and deltamethrin were within 60 min. Pyrethroid-treated flies frequently showed rapid and prolonged knockdown. Especially for pyrethroids, many aborted eggs or larvae were covered with white sticky fluid. It is suggested that insecticides causes high rates of abortion by general relaxation of maternal muscles, thus opening the vaginal sphincter, smoothing the uterine wall and allowing accumulated milk gland secretions to flow into the uterus. This reduces friction between contents and the uterine wall and the egg or larva escapes passively through the vaginal aperture.",major,deltamethrin,minor,deltamethrin,major,Dieldrin,minor,Dieldrin,major,effects,minor,effects,major,Fenitrothion,minor,Fenitrothion,major,Fenvalerate,minor,Fenvalerate,major,insecticides,minor,insecticides,major,Permethrin,minor,Permethrin,major,Phenothrin,minor,Phenothrin,major,physiology,minor,physiology,major,Propoxur,minor,Propoxur,major,reproduction,minor,reproduction,major,reproductive organs,minor,reproductive organs,major,Diptera,minor,Diptera,major,Glossina palpalis,minor,Glossina palpalis,major,Glossina palpalis palpalis,minor,Glossina palpalis palpalis,major,Glossinidae,minor,Glossinidae,minor,insects,minor,Hexapoda,minor,arthropods,minor,invertebrates,minor,animals,minor,eukaryotes,minor,Glossina,minor,Glossinidae,minor,Diptera,minor,Glossina palpalis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Riordan, E.
